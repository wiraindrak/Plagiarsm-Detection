What Is the InterGem Show?
SPRING 2009 SCHEDULE NOW AVAILABLE!
Intergem Customers Please Note: Starting September 12, 2008, all customers, regardless of age, must either purchase a ticket for the show or have an approved free pass in order to enter the show. This change in policy comes after feedback from Intergem customers and exhibitors alike. We thank you very much for your cooperation.
Whether you are looking for a diamond engagement ring, beautiful colored gemstones or a one-of-a-kind gift, you will find it all right here at the International Gem & Jewelry Shows.
Exhibitors from around the World offer a huge selection of quality jewelry of all kinds including loose colored gemstones, fine finished jewelry, fashion jewelry, beads and more.  If the huge selection is not enough incentive to visit our shows, how about incredible savings?! At the International Gem & Jewelry Shows, you will enjoy discounts of 20% to 40% off of the regular retail price.

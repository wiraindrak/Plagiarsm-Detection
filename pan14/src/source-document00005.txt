The proponents argued that exclusively heterosexual marriage was "an essential institution of ", that leaving the constitution unchanged would "result in public schools teaching our kids that gay marriage is okay", and that gays would "redefine marriage for everyone else." Opponents argued that "the freedom to marry is fundamental to our society", that the California constitution "should guarantee the same freedom and rights to everyone" and that the proposition "mandates one set of rules for gay and lesbian couples and another set for everyone else."

In order to qualify for the ballot, Proposition 8 needed 694,354 valid petition signatures, equal to 8% of the total votes cast for governor in the November 2006 General Election. The initiative proponents submitted 1,120,801 signatures, and on June 2, 2008, the initiative qualified for the November 4, 2008 election ballot through the random sample signature check. [9]
[] edit Changes to ballot title and summary
During the initiative process, the measure was known by three different titles: a proposed title, a circulating title and a ballot title. The title, as initially proposed by the measure's proponents, was "The California Marriage Protection Act." In November 2007, the Office of the prepared its "circulating title and summary" that is, the title and summary to be used on the initiative's signature petition in accordance with California Election Code 9002, 9004. Its circulating title was "Limit on Marriage. Constitutional Amendment" and the summary stated that the measure "amends the California Constitution to provide that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California." California Attorney General [10] [11]
After the California Supreme Court issued its May 2008 ruling, which found laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage to be unconstitutional, the Office of the certified the measure for the November 4, 2008 election, leaving intact its circulating title and summary. In re Marriage Cases California Secretary of State [9]
Upon certification, it was sent back to the office in accordance with California Election Code 9051 for preparation of a "ballot title and summary" to be used on the ballot and in the official voter guide. Thus, the measure's third, and final, title became "Eliminates Rights of Same-Sex Couples to Marry. Initiative Constitutional Amendment." The ballot summary read that the measure "changes the California Constitution to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry in California". Attorney General's [12] [13] [14]
Proponents of the measure objected to the wording of the ballot title and summary on the grounds that they were argumentative and prejudicial. The resulting legal petition was dismissed August 7, 2008 by California Superior Court Judge Timothy M. Frawley, who ruled that "the title and summary includes an essentially verbatim recital of the text of the measure itself", and that the change was valid because the measure did, in fact, eliminate a right upheld by the California Supreme Court.Jansson v. Bowen [15] [16]

Further information: California Constitution#Amendments and revisions
On July 16, 2008, the California Supreme Court denied a petition calling for the removal of Proposition 8 from the November ballot. The petition asserted the proposition should not be on the ballot on the grounds it was a constitutional revision that only the Legislature or a constitutional convention could place before voters. Opponents also argued that the petitions circulated to qualify the measure for the ballot inaccurately summarized its effect. The court denied the petition without comment. As a general rule, it is improper for courts to adjudicate pre-election challenges to a measure's substantive validity. The question of whether Proposition 8 is a constitutional amendment or constitutional revision remains unresolved, and a new petition arguing that Proposition 8 is a revision was filed by civil rights groups on November 5, 2008. [18] [19] [20]
[] edit Challenge to revised title and summary
On July 22, 2008, Proposition 8 supporters mounted a legal challenge to the revised ballot title and summary, contending that Attorney General Brown had inserted "inflammatory" language that would "unduly prejudice voters against" Proposition 8. Supporters claimed that research showed that an attorney general had never used an active verb like eliminates in the title of a ballot measure in the past fifty years in which ballot measures have been used. Representatives of the Attorney General produced twelve examples of ballot measures using the word "eliminates" and vouched for the neutrality and accuracy of the ballot language. [21] [22] [23] [24]
On August 8, 2008, the California Superior Court turned down the legal challenge, affirming the new title and summary, stating, "[t]he title and summary is not false or misleading because it states that Proposition 8 would 'eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry' in California. The California Supreme Court unequivocally held that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry under the California Constitution." That same day, proponents of Prop. 8 filed an emergency appeal with the state appeals court. The Court of Appeal denied their petition later that day and supporters did not seek a review by the . The deadline for court action on the wording of ballot summaries and arguments in the voter pamphlet was August 11, 2008. [25] [17] Supreme Court of California [26] [27] [28]
[] edit Court-ordered rewording
While turning down the challenge to the title and summary, the California Superior Court also found that the Yes on 8 campaign had overstated its ballot argument on the measure's impact on public schools and ordered a minor change in wording. The original arguments included a claim that the Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage requires teachers to tell their students, as young as kindergarten age, that same-sex marriage is the same as opposite-sex marriage. The court said the Yes on 8 argument was false because instruction on marriage is not required and parents can withdraw their children. The court said the ballot argument could be preserved by rewording it to state that teachers "may" or "could" be required to tell children there is no difference between same-sex and opposite-sex marriage.

[] edit Campaign spending
By Election Day, volunteers on both sides spent thousands of hours getting their messages across to the state's 17.3 million registered voters. The campaigns for and against Proposition 8 raised $39.9 million and $43.3 million, respectively. Contributions totaled over $83 million from over 64,000 people in all fifty states and more than twenty foreign countries, setting a new record nationally for a social policy initiative and trumping every other race in the country in spending except the presidential contest. Contributions were much greater than those of previous same-sex marriage initiatives. Between 2004 and 2006, 22 such measures were on ballots around the country, and donations to all of them combined totaled $31.4 million, according to the nonpartisan National Institute on Money in State Politics.

ProtectMarriage.com reportedly sent letters requesting that previous contributors to Equality California make similar donations to ProtectMarriage.com, stating, "It is only fair for Proposition 8 supporters to know which companies and organizations oppose traditional marriage." A ProtectMarriage.com spokeswoman estimated that 36 companies were targeted for the letter. [34] [35] [36] [37]
After the election, Proposition 8 supporters requested that the California Secretary of State remove information posted on the Internet that details reported donations. [38]
[] edit "Whether You Like It or Not" advertisement
In the months leading up to Election Day, Proposition 8 supporters released a commercial featuring stating in a speech regarding same-sex marriage: "This door's wide open now. It's going to happen, whether you like it or not." Some observers noted that polls shifted in favor of Proposition 8 following the release of the commercial; this, in turn, led to much speculation about Newsom s unwitting role in the passage of the amendment. A January 2009 article stated: San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom [39] [40] [41] Newsweek
[A]sk average Californians what they remember about Newsom at the moment, and they're likely to offer six words: "whether you like it or not." That's what Newsom said about gay marriage it was coming to California, and America, whether you like it or not. He said it in a speech, shortly after the California Supreme Court extended marriage rights to gays and lesbians. But his words were captured for posterity in an ad for Proposition 8, the ballot initiative seeking to reverse that decision. The ad begins with footage of a gloating Newsom grinning widely and gesturing broadly as he exclaims "the door's wide open, it's going to happen, whether you like it or not" ... Airing across the state, the ad was viewed as among the most effective in support of the ban. [42]

[] edit CNN exit poll
CNN conducted an exit poll representing the only source of data on voter demographics in California in the 2008 election. Interpreting this exit poll requires some care as CNN did not provide the poll locations where the surveys were conducted. This can be a problem because exit polls are more inaccurate than regular due to an intrinsic geographical bias stemming from the fact that most precincts are not sampled. [143] [144] opinion polls [145]
The statistical trends from the CNN exit poll of 2,240 voters suggested that an array of voters came out both in opposition to and in support of Proposition 8, with no single demographic group making up all of either the Yes or No vote. These demographic trends were published in the media, including the following:

A pending legal issue is whether approximately 18,000 same-sex marriages already in effect would be retroactively annulled by the constitutional change or whether they would be preserved, since the amendment does not state explicitly that it would nullify same-sex marriages performed before the change took effect. California Attorney General Jerry Brown said that existing same-sex marriages would be unaffected, but other legal experts are uncertain. The official proponents of Proposition 8 argue in their November 19, 2008 brief to the Court that the measure does annul existing same-sex marriages. [147]

On November 13, 2008, the California Supreme Court asked state Attorney General Brown for an opinion on whether the Court should accept these cases for review and whether the measure should be suspended while they decide the case. On November 19, the Court accepted three lawsuits challenging Proposition 8 but denied the requests to stay its enforcement. The Court asked for final briefs by January 5, 2009.

Karger charged that the LDS Church's failure to report "non-monetary contributions" placed it in violation of California's Political Reform Act. LDS Church spokesman Scott Trotter denied the charges, saying the church had "fully complied with the reporting requirements". However, in a report filed with the California Secretary of State's office January 30, 2009, the LDS Church reported its non-monetary expenditures as $189,903.58..

The reported on February 2, 2009: Boston Herald
"While many church members had donated directly to the Yes on 8 campaign - some estimates of Mormon giving range as high as $20 million - the church itself had previously reported little direct campaign activity. But in the filing made Friday, the Mormon church reported thousands in travel expenses, such as airline tickets, hotel rooms and car rentals for the campaign. The church also reported $96,849.31 worth of 'compensated staff time' - hours that church employees spent working to pass the same-sex marriage ban. [177]
In a statement issued February 2, 2009, the LDS Church defended itself against "erroneous news reports," saying its subsequent disclosure was "in no way prompted by an investigation by the California Fair Political Practices Commission," that "We believe we have complied with California law," and that the report's filing date met the January 31, 2009 deadline.
"The Church, like other organizations on both sides of the ballot issue, was required to publicly file these donations by the 31 January deadline. The Church has been filing required contribution reports throughout the campaign. Those earlier donations initially stated were filed for specific time periods prior to this last reporting period, as required by law. Other groups are also filing their final contribution reports to meet the same deadline." [178]

On January 7, 2009, supporters of Proposition 8 filed a federal lawsuit to block public disclosure of their donations. Alleging threats against their lives as well as other forms of harassment, the lawsuit also requested a preliminary injunction that ordered the California Secretary of State to remove information about donations posted on its website. Opponents of Proposition 8 called it "hypocritical" that its supporters would refer to their support of the measure as the "will of the people" while seeking to overturn voter-approved campaign disclosure laws. U.S. District Judge Morrison England, Jr. denied that request on January 29; he said that the public had the right to know about donors of political causes, that he didn't agree that the plaintiffs had a probability of success in court, and that they had not proven they would suffer "irreparable injury" if he did not grant the preliminary injunction.

Designed to look and operate just like the real machine, the T190 RC is available in two frequencies, 26.995 mhz and 27.095 mhz (currently out of stock). Radio crystals inside the hand controller and receiver limit communication to only the specified frequency. This means less interference from outside electrical sources. Radio crystals also extend the distance of operation. The loader operates just like the real machine. There is a separate control for independent bucket dump and rollback. The large hand controller operates the forward, reverse and turning functions as well as raising and lowering the booms. Front and rear lights function when the controller levers or buttons are activated. The T190 is powered by a rechargeable 7.2v battery pack. The hand controller, battery, charger, and a 9v battery for the hand controller, are packaged with each unit. Approx. size 12 1/2" long to the bucket and 7 1/2" high. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR OUTDOOR USE, NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 8 YEARS OLD.

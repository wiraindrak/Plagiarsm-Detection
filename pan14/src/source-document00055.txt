"Hannah" is a flaxen sorrel, minimal sabino mare, standing a solid 16 hands. She is uncommonly large for a Curly mare, and has the substance of an old fashioned Warmblood. ButHannah has more than size, she is a wonderful mom, and as a riding horse, she has a good mind that is willing and receptive to positive training techniques. She has feet like iron and substance to stay sounds for a lifetime of hard work.
After several years of logging miles on the trails, Hannah is embarking on a dual career, broodmare and dressage horse.
Our latest news... Hannah's fall has been full of firsts. She attended her first dressage clinic with J. Ashton Moore in October, 2006. She wowed everyone with her solid work ethic, sweet disposition, calm and even temperament and most of all, how fast she caught on and how hard she tried everything we asked her to do. I've never worked with a horse that learned so quickly.
As an added benefit, everyone loved her curly,blond mane & forelock and her curly eyelashes! She was a perfect lady for the full 4 days and everyone loved her!
This past fall, Hannah attended her first dressage shows and after limited showing (and limited trainning) she earned the 2006 Training Level Dressage HOY award in the Anmateur division (ridden by an amateur).
At this time, do to health reasons, I am sadly offering Hannah for sale and hope to find a perfect home for her. She is not suitable for a beginner but would be excellent for an intermediate rider that is not intimidated by her size. Priced at $12,000. 864-969-2805 email: Dances With Hooves

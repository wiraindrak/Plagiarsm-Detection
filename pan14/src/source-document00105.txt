Educators and their families  up to four people total  will be admitted free into Mystic Seaport Saturday and Sunday, April 12-13.
 
Teachers, administrators and support staff are welcome. Free admission will be granted upon presentation of a school or union ID card or a copy of school letterhead.
 
The sixth annual event is part of the Museums continuous efforts to help teachers reach their classroom goals as well as provide an opportunity for educators to strengthen the partnership between schools and museums.
 
Education is a core value of the Museum, said Susan Funk, vice president for education and public programs. We appreciate the work educators do every day. This is our way of saying thanks.
 
Science and technology are at the center of this years event, as the Museum seeks to inform educators that it offers students much more than maritime history. Special activities include 30-minute sampler tours of Weather Wise and Force & Motion, the Museums two new science-based guided tours designed for school groups as well as an examination of optical innovations through the use of telescopes and an exploration of the technology behind ship building.

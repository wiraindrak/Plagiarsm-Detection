Our new protective garden raised beds can be used all year round with these sturdy cold frames. Your plants will benefit greatly from the increased temperatures and protection from both weather and pest damage. The cold frame is made from strong and heat retaining polycarbonate and has been designed with three sliding roof panels to give you easy access and ventilation. The long lasting aluminium frame simply screws on top of your raised bed. (You'll need a drill to fix the frame in place and self tapping screws.)

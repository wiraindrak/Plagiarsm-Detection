     Uranus (pronounced YOOR un nus) is the seventh planet from the sun. It is 1 billion, 783 million miles from the sun. Uranus is more than 19 times farther from the sun than Earth is. It is so far away from the sun that light takes two hours and forty minutes to get there! Uranus is so far from the sun that it is very, very cold.      Uranus is a gas giant with a rocky center. It does not have a solid surface. It is the third largest planet. It is about four times bigger than Earth. It has 27 moons. Uranus looks blue-green. A thick haze covers the planet. Uranus is a sideways planet!1

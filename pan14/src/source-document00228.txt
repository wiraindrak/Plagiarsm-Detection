This is a must read book for any church pastor or church leader. Rick Warren has basically written a book which details the methods he has used to grow a church of many thousands in West Coast well heeled well educated America. The question is do those same methods work in the UK (or whichever context you find yourself in). I think the answer is yes - the stuff he writes about is just plain old common sense and very little to do with his particular context. It's down and dirty bog standard biblical church growth stuff. Get it - read it. Get another copy and give it to your church pastor (if you're not them). In fact buy one for every member of your church leadership team.

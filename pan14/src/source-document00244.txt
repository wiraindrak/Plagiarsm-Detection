I'm not a computer geek, but I really like this product. I have a large wood computer cabinet with a slide out desk top and below that a slide out keyboard tray. My wires were constantly getting caught every time I opened and closed up my desk. This has made everything so much easier. One of the best investments I made.

I have been back and forth for weeks with Logitech Tech support and I still cannot get the darn software for this pen installed. The latest gem: uninstall my McAfee software and then try to install again. I don't think so. I have wasted hours on this usless product and now will just demand my money back. Don't even think about getting this clunker.

, is made by Wacom, Usually ships in 24 hours. The list price is around US$449.99. Wacom Intuos3 9 x 12-Inch USB Tablet--Metallic Gray(*The prices are subject to change)
My first tablet was a Graphire3 4x6 tablet and after getting accustomed to using a tablet, digital artwork became much more enjoyable for me and allowed me to do so many more things with digital art that I couldn't do with a mouse. I soon realized that, for me, I needed more workable area and so I upgraded to the Intuos3 9x12 and I'm glad I did! My only regret is that I don't draw more than I do because I have difficulty getting motivated to do so. The options you have in the software to allow you to set the screen size vs. tablet working area is great for anyone that draws with "smaller" strokes and even though the tablet footprint is huge, it does just fine for me in my lap. It's pricey but what can you expect? You are getting the top of the line tablet from Wacom and it's well worth it in my opinion. The added discount you get for Photoshop CS3 doubles the worth of investing in an awesome tool for digital artists. :}

Stampede Steel Manufacturers Ltd. is located in Linden, Alberta, Canada, a small industrious community approximately one hour north of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Stampede Steel was established in 1991 and has rapidly grown into a major supplier to the cattle handling and feedlot equipment industry.

To allow both plants to focus on manufacturing quality products, a new sales organization, Stampede Sales has been created. Stampede Sales will market all the great Stampede Steel cattle handling equipment in Canada and the United States.
Stampede Steel strives to improve existing products and make our equipment more efficient and safer for the user and the livestock. We are known for our innovative changes to methods that have been used for years.

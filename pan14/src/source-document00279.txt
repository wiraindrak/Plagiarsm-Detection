Review of Kamat's Potpourri
December 7, 1999"Much Too Much" Digital Hindustan Times
might as well be crass - it's one sure way of getting your attention - and ask you if you know . You wouldn't know, but then your thoughts on the matter aren't too polite. at asks: "Were they striched (sic)? Were they padded?" You want the answer, go there yourself. But the Potpourri's about far more than baffling bodices. It's about that diligently dogtagged bagatelle of bodybags called human history. The Website, exhaustive and flamboyant in its contents, follows the current Indian cultural preoccupation with being simply swank or swankly simple, any way you want it. If you're not one of those urban dilettanti who doesn't know a shahtoosh from a Phulwara suit, the substantial content that has gone into the site won't show through its poker-faced exterior. Inside is truly a potpourri: the Mahatma as an investment advisor, the , a rare section on , marketplace maundering about how "exploitation of the poor is one definite sign of progress", sports and utility vehicles from heaven. You get the picture. It doesn't take much to notice that the entire site showcases the works of the remarkably prolix Kamat family, and the fact that it has grown from a homepage on AOL in November 1995 with a tour of the country in "photo stubs" to a compendium in full sail makes it a showcase for what a lot of us fatheads should be doing - getting culturally hyperlinked.Iwhether ancient Indian women wore brasKamat's Potpourri http://www.kamat.com/index.html World Kannada ConferenceBuddhism in India

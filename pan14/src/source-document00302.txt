SPOT-5 Satellite Imagery and Sensor Characteristics
Satellite Imaging Corporation acquires and provides SPOT-5 satellite imagery worldwide.
About the SPOT-5 Satellite Sensor
The SPOT-5 Earth observation satellite was successfully placed into orbit by an Ariane 4 from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou during the night of 3 to 4 May 2002.
The VEGETATION 2 passenger instrument on SPOT-5 also provides continuity of around the globe, like its predecessor on SPOT-4. environmental monitoring
SPOT Image Corporation is composed of four subsidiaries, including an office in Germany and a dense global network of receiving stations, channel partners, and distributors. Satellite Imaging Corporation is an official distributor for SPOT Image Corporation.
Compared to its predecessors, SPOT-5 offers greatly enhanced capabilities, which provide additional cost-effective imaging solutions. Thanks to SPOT-5's improved 5-metre and 2.5-metre resolution and wide imaging swath, which covers 60 x 60 km or 60 km x 120 km in twin-instrument mode, the SPOT-5 satellite provides an ideal balance between high resolution and wide-area coverage. The coverage offered by SPOT-5 is a key asset for applications such as medium-scale mapping (at 1:25 000 and 1:10 000 locally), urban and rural planning, , and natural disaster management. SPOT-5's other key feature is the unprecedented acquisition capability of the on-board HRS stereo viewing instrument, which can cover vast areas in a single pass. Stereo pair imagery is vital for applications that call for and computer environments, such as flight simulator databases, pipeline corridors, and mobile phone network planning. oil and gas exploration 3D terrain modeling

Wind Power
Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into useful form, such as electricity, using wind turbines such as Southwest Windpower's Air-X series. Wind energy is plentiful, renewable, widely distributed, clean, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions when it displaces fossil-fuel-derived electricity. Because of the inconsistency of wind, it can present problems when wind power is used for a large portion of your energy demand. Affordable Solar carries wind turbines for a variety of wind power applications, including replacement parts such as nose cones and blade sets.

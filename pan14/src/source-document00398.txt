Moths
A Mexican "Jumping" Bean jumps because a moth larva living inside the bean squirms when it gets warm.
The female moth lays between 60 and 300 eggs
There are about 13,000 species of moths in North America and about 165,000 species in the world. Most moths are nocturnal but seem to be attracted to light (for example, a porch light or a fire). One reason is that because moths are , they navigate, or find their way around by using the moon as a point of reference. Moths can become confused by any other light source and they basically get "lost". As a result, they typically stay where they are, making it look like they are attracted to the light.

Pampered Chef products are known for their long lasting durability and high quality. The pieces are reasonably priced; especially in light of the fact that they will last a lifetime if properly cared for, and the company sells everything from bamboo toast tongs, to stoneware pizza stones.
The full line of Pampered Chef products includes bakeware, stoneware, outdoor items, bamboo cookware, kitchenware, various gadgets, utensils, and utting edgeknives. Among the products in each category are bamboo utensils for cooking and cheeseboards; every conceivable kind, shape, and type of baking pan in non-stick finishes as well as all the gadgets and measuring cups necessary for the task; outdoor grill tools, utensil caddy and gizmos to make barbeques easy; stoneware, which boasts not one or two simple pizza stones, but over 17 different items all made of quality, durable material; a knife selection that includes chef grade carvers and fancy shape cutters, plus Santoku knives; and of course the kitchenware category with tons of neat tools, peelers, measurers, cutters, paring knives, spoons, egg separators, funnels, garlic presses, and too many more to list.
The majority of the over 60,000 independent representatives selling the products through mostly in-home house parties, are also, of course, customers; since demonstrating and using the products themselves gives them a better understanding of what they are trying to sell. Beyond even that, it seems to be the customers who are the most vocal supporters of Pampered Chef products.

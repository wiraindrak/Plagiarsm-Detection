DJ Rap
Introduction
Before DJ equipment               became widely available to consumers, most DJ's learned their               skills at discotheques. Typically, experienced jocks passed on               their techniques to new DJ's. As a "resident" (i.e.,               a DJ with a steady gig), the DJ had access to professional equipment,               a pro-audio sound-system, and promotional music mixes -- which               at that time -- gave the Club DJ's a virtual monopoly on the               presentation and performance of  music. Eventually               these club jocks got slots on the radio and the first "mix-shows"               emerged (such as Chicago's Hot Mix 5 on WBMX-FM). As a result,               Club DJ music and skills such as beat mixing were exposed to               the masses.dance
Perhaps the               most significant development in the evolution of DJ equipment               occurred when Technics released the "direct-drive"               SL-1200 in 1974, and the improved SL-1200MK2 Turntable in 1978-79.               Still considered the industry standard, the "twelve-hundred"               enabled DJ's to scratch and mix without fear of breaking and/or               stretching the belt found in belt-drive turntables.
Hip Hop, which               originated in the Bronx (New York) during the early-to-mid-70's,               strongly influenced the evolution of DJ equipment - particularly               turntablism. DJ's such as Kool Herc (first DJ to loop two identical               records on two turntables-1973), Grand Wizard Theodore (first               DJ to scratch-1977), Grandmaster Flash ("peak-a-boo cue               system"), and Afrika Bambaataa ("godfather of hip hop"               - produced ) invented turntable techniques               that eventually spread throughout the world - particularly when               Grand Mixer DST performed on the turntables in Herbie Hancock's               "Rockit" video (1980's). As a result, scratching and               turntablism was exposed to the masses.Planet Rock
With the growth               of raves in the late-80's and 90's, the demand for DJ equipment               also grew. Speciality shops catering to rave and hip hop DJ's               proliferated and almost anyone that wanted to become a DJ had               access to professional equipment and music. At roughly the same               time -- because of the Internet -- DJ remixes could be obtained               for free and sometimes quicker than conventional distribution               methods. The nightclub DJs' monopoly in breaking new dance music               had ended -- as well as a portion of the Club DJ's value to record               labels and artists.
The               Basic Equipment Set-Up
As Table 1 below               shows, the basic DJ set-up includes two turntables (and/or two               CD players), headphones, RCA stereo cables, and a DJ mixer, which               is connected to an amp and/or amp rack via the mixer's master               output. It should be noted that many DJ's on a budget often employ               the auxiliary input on their home stereos in lieu of an expensive               amp/speaker set-up. The mixer's "crossfader" (the horizontal               bar on the mixer) enables the DJ to switch the volume between               Channel 1 (the green turntable on the left) and Channel 2 (the               black turntable on the right). Each channel has an "upfader"               volume control (the vertical bars) and can usually accommodate               two input sources (such as phono and CD). In addition, many mixers               have "gains" (aka "trim") that also controls               a particular channel's volume. With the addition of the master               volume, which controls total volume output, a DJ usually has               four places to control a song's volume (crossfader, channel gain,               upfader, and master volume) -- with the crossfader serving as               the bridge between channels.
A DJ should               also know how to work a mixer's (or rack's) equalizer (EQ). According               to DJ Timothy               Heit ,               "."because hearing is normally around 4 kHz, you want to               lower that frequency (and perhaps the frequencies near it) on               the equalizer. This creates a comfortable listening environment               (i.e., the customers can hear one another). While desirable,               higher frequencies, such as tweeters, can damage hearing. However,               low-end bass frequencies are not as damaging - it tends to cause               listening fatigue instead
Purchasing               Equipment
Today, it's               not uncommon to find DJ's that practice, record, and even remix               tracks at home studios. If you're about to start a home DJ-studio               or need mobile DJ equipment, then consider investing in equipment               that accommodates your style. Hip hop DJ's for example, usually               purchase scratch/battle mixers and direct-drive turntables. It               should be noted that unless you're on a strict budget, avoid               purchasing belt-drive turntables. On the other hand, if you plan               on spinning corporate clubs, mobile-weddings, and/or MP3's, you'll               most likely mix on CD players (such as Pioneer's CDJ series)               or computer programs, such as Rane Serato Scratch Live. Ideally,               you should learn to play CD players and turntables interchangeably               (so that your music sets aren't constrained). DJ's such as Josh               Wink employ CD's and vinyl equally.
DJ               Software Programs/Rane Serato Scratch Live
A substantial               number of modern DJ's are employing DJ software programs such               as Rane               Serato Scratch Live to augment their performances. These programs are designed to               be used with a computer laptop (often a Mac), as well as two               turntables/CD players and a DJ mixer. This type of program enables               the DJ to select music files (i.e., MP3's) on the computer hard               drive to be played along with a time-coded vinyl record or CD.               With music downloading becoming an essential part of the DJ's               music library, programs like Rane Serato Scratch Live enable               DJ's to perform current tracks on turntables with turntablist               skills. In addition to Rane Serato Scratch Live, other programs               include Virtual               DJ ,               and Traktor               Pro by Native Instruments.

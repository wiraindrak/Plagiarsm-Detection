If you do not finish each multiple-choice section of the test, your score will depend on the number of questions answered within each section. Total GMAT scores range from 200 to 800. 65% of test takers score between 400 and 600. A great score on the GMAT does not however guarantee admission to the school of your choice. A low score can mean you do not qualify at all for a business school program. GMAT scores are also on the rise, which is making acceptance to top schools more competitive. The average score for acceptance to top ten business schools has risen almost 100 points in the last 15 years. This means you need to have near a 700 score to be considered for entrance to the best schools. As more students take the GMAT and vie for limited openings in top schools, the competition for top scores will continue to grow.

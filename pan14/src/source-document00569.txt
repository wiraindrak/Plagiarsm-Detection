Tip 40: Dont weigh yourself too often!
Weight Loss Tip Posted by: Admin at 9:18 am
Donâ€™t weight yourself too often. Use a tape measure and the fit of your clothes to monitor weight loss. Take regular measurements of your arms, thighs, waist, hips etc. Your bodyweight fluctuates throughout the day. You weigh more at night time than you do on the morning. If you weigh yourself too often you may get disappointed when you see slight weight gains.

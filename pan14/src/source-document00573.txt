We are often asked if we accept Gift Certificates from BedAndBreakfast.com. We accept BedAndBreakfast.com Gift Certificates for the amount of the room rate (but not for taxes). However, since BedAndBreakfast.com Gift Certificates are already substantially discounted, we are not able to accept them in conjunction with any other discounted rates. In other words, you may use either the BedAndBreakfast.com Gift Certificate the other discount, but not both.NOTE:door

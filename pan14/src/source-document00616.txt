HP showed off it’s new Mini 2140 netbook at the ICES (International Consumer Electronics Show)in Las Vegas earlier this week, and it’s the business.
It comes encased in a sweet aluminium case very similar to their older under powered 2133. HP have made a lot of improvements when comparing this to a 2133 or even the 1000 model. They are hoping that not only the home user will be buying this model but HP also are aiming this at the business world.
HP have option of 3 cell and 6 cell batteries with this model and HP are claiming that the 6 cell option will churn out a staggering 8hrs of life between charges, this obviously depends on how you use the machine.
Other options include either a 160GB HDD (Hard Disk Drive) or an 80GB SSD (Solid State Drive). Operating system option include Windows XP, XP Professional as well as SUSE Linux and possibly Vista Business.
The Intel Atom will be at the heart of the 2140 and the system can support up to 2GB of memory, the 2140 also boasts a 10.1″ screen.
All in all this looks like a very nice machine even though it will weigh slightly more than it’s plastic competition but hey, something had to give to make a quality machine. HP reckon that the 2140 will be released later this month.

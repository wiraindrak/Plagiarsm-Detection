Stretching is the best way to relieve forearm pain. This encourages tissues that are adhered to release from one another in the quickest way possible. It's also a great way to balance the function of the muscles on both sides of the forearms. It's important to choose stretching exercises that affect all of the muscles of the forearms independently. Because your injury has developed as a result of how you use your hands and arms, it is impossible to tell at the beginning which muscles are creating your problem. So, choose stretches that work on all the muscles of the forearms and pay attention to how they feel as you practice them. This will give you clues as to which muscles are causing your symptoms. After any period of stretching, be sure to rest your arms for at least 30 seconds before doing something new with your hands. This allows the muscle tissue time to recover from the stretch. Remember that stretching should never be painful in any way. In addition to stretching it's important to identify other sources of forearm strain and try to eliminate as much of that strain as possible. If you use your hands extensively in your work, your forearm muscles are already under a lot of strain in the normal course of your day. To avoid further strain to your forearms, consider eliminating stressful activities like hand-intensive sports and hobbies. Choose only to do the most essential things with your hands and arms while you are trying to recover and your arms will thank you. As always, consistency and care are the most important concepts to grasp when restoring forearms to normal, pain-free function and range of motion. Pay close attention to the sensations your body sends as you stretch. Never overdo it and never cause pain. Adequate intake is also very important. Muscles are designed to slide and glide across one another. Imagine how that sliding and gliding would be affected if the tissues are dry and sticky!
Forearm Pain Self Care
Forearm pain self care takes on an interesting twist when you consider the anatomy of the forearms. When you use your hands, muscles on one side of the forearms contract while the muscles on the other side lengthen. In order for you to be pain free, these muscles must be able to work in a balanced way. So, if one side is tight or adhered, the other side will have to overwork to compensate.This can lead to pain and injury.

Professor emeritus and network broadcast news veteran Bill Knowles returned from a Fulbright stint in Jordan (no, not the one in Montana) with a new appreciation for his students' culture.
R-TV junior recently received the Walter Patterson Scholarship for the 2009-10 school year, presented to outstanding students by the Broadcast Education Association. "I really didn't expect to win it but it was good news when I did," Houchin, one of 15 students from 14 universities to win a BEA scholarship, said. Houchin's winning essay focused on his work at KBGA college radio and his plans for a radio broadcast career. This is the seventh straight year a student from UM has been awarded a BEA scholarship.

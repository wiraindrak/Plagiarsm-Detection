Goals and Programming:
Camp Winnamocka is a one and two week summer adventure camp for boys and girls ages 7-15. The Winnamocka experience: Winnamocka is a place where the imagination soars as you sail across a lake on a miniature pirate ship, a place where "please" and "thank you" get a smile; a place where a child discovers the wonderful feeling of being a part of a "team;" a place where the most common sight is a smile and the most common sound is laughter. Winnamocka's Mission Statement: Positive attitudes and positive people create a special place to enhance imagination, creativity, teamwork, and happy times in a safe and unique environment for children of all personalities and backgrounds.

The High Cost of Avoidable Disease
Alexian Brothers Corporate and Community Wellness is committed to helping organizations control escalating healthcare costs.  Billions of dollars are spent annually on healthcare and much of the spending could be avoided.  Ninety percent of Type 2 diabetes and 80 percent of coronary heart disease could be avoided or delayed with regular physical activity, quitting smoking, and reducing stress.  (SOURCE:  World Health Organization, 2005)  Specific types of cancers, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are linked to lifestyle behaviors and can prematurely diminish the health and productivity of individuals.

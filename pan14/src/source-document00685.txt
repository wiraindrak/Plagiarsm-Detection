"Mom wary of cooking now a Chef By Diana Parker The Journal Gazette A little more than four years ago, Stephanie Ball's husband, Dennis, did 98 percent of the cooking for the family. Then one day Ball's grandmother encouraged her to attend a Pampered Chef show, and life changed.
Pampered Chef is a direct seller of kitchen tools at in-home cooking shows.

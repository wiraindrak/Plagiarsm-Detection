Born 3 August 1913 at Nahant, Mass., William Bacon Lovering graduated from Harvard and on 2 August 1940 enlisted in the Naval Reserve. Appointed a midshipman 22 November, he attended Abbott Hall Naval Reserve Midshipmen School at Northwestern University in Chicago. He was commissioned an ensign 28 February 1941 and assigned to the destroyer USS (DD-412). Ensign Lovering died during the Battle of Midway when was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine and sunk 6 June 1942 while aiding in the salvage of (CV-5). Four torpedoes were loosed towards . Two missed; one passed under striking , and the fourth hit the destroyer amidships, breaking the destroyer back. As the debris from the explosion rained down and the ships lurched apart, it was apparent that was doomed after breaking in two. Life rafts were lowered and rescue efforts began by ships in company. The ship sank in just 4 minutes, and following the sinking a violent underwater explosion caused many deaths in the water, bringing the toll in dead to over 80. Ensign William B. Lovering was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart. His other awards include the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal and World War II Victory Medal.. USS (DE-39) was the first ship to be named in his honor. Althought DE-272 was to be named Lovering, her name was changed prior to her transfer to the Royal Navy.

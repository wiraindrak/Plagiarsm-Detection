Type with Tactus
You can learn to touch keyboard in just 4 hours with the TACTUS Keyboard and the TACTUS Touch Keyboarding Program. The TACTUS Touch Keyboarding Program is specifically designed for use with the TACTUS Keyboard and should be completed in one 4-hour session. (If one prefers, the program can also be taken in two 2-hour sessions, provided that one does not use the the computer in between the two sessions.) The reason for this is that, from the moment one completes the program, one must use the keyboard in touch typing mode and never again with the "hunt-and-peck" method. ("Touch typing" mode means using the correct finger for each key.) A good time to take the program is the week-end; we recommend taking the program in the morning, when one is fresh.

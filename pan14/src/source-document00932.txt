Our Approach
Content of Program
first analyze the results to evaluate the student's strengths and weaknesses in the areas of Algebra, Functions, Geometry, and Trigonometry. If students are unsure whether to take the Math Level 1 or Level 2 test, we recommend that they take diagnostic tests in both. The results of these tests, along with other factors, help students determine which test to take. Tutors diagnostic test
The Math Level 2 is much more rigorous than the Math Level 1, testing material at a more complex level and covering some areas that the Math Level 1 does not. For instance, both tests include questions about basic conic sections (such as the parabola and the circle), but the Math Level 2 also tests students' knowledge of the ellipse and the hyperbola. Students preparing for the Math Level 2 will develop a thorough understanding of these areas as well as many other important mathematical concepts such as logarithms, matrices, and geometric and recursive sequences.
Throughout the program, tutors teach mathematical concepts and problem-solving approaches to dozens of question types, from solving a triangle with the Law of Cosines to finding the remainder in polynomial division. Finally, after devoting several tutoring sessions to reviewing the material on the test, we use timed to gauge progress, identify gaps, and improve scores. practice tests

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a network of 24 satellites orbiting the earth, and represents a $13 billion investment from the U. S. Government. Each satellite carries on-board triple-redundant atomic clocks which are maintained accurate and traceable to UTC (Universal Coordinated time) by the U.S. Department of Defense and the U. S. Naval Observatory. The Spectracom NetClock/GTP (Global Time Provider) Master Clock automatically tracks up to eight satellites simultaneously, and provides extremely accurate timing by synchronizing to the satellites atomic clocks. Because the GPS satellite system blankets the earth, the NetClock/GTP can be used anywhere on our planet. A variety of time code outputs are available to meet the requirements of numerous systems. NetClock/GTP is ideally suited for delivering system-wide split-second timing information to computer and IRIG B synchronized systems. An international power supply is available for applications outside North America.

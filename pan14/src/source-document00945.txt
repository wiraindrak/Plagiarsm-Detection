About Rare Bleeding Disorders
While rare bleeding disorders -- those other than factors VIII and IX hemophilia or von Willebrand's disease -- are not our strongest area of expertise, we are glad to help you access information and resources.
As a starting point for general information, we recommend the following:
Excellent source of information about the various types of rare bleeding disorders.
Good source of information, particularly for women with bleeding disorders, excellent support network.
For local treatment information, contact the Hemophilia Program at the Puget Sound Blood Center.
Below is a table that provides very basic information about every known inherited bleeding disorder, plus some other information, originally published in the American Journal of Medicine:
Inherited Bleeding Disorders
Just as deficiency of certain players in the coagulation cascade leads to a thrombotic tendency, deficiencies in other coagulation factors leads toward a tendency to bleed. In the normal physiologic state, factors XIa, VIIa, IXa Va, Xa, VIIa, and thrombin are procoagulants. Antithrombin III, Proteins C & S, thrombomodulin, and plasmin function as anticoagulants. Deficiencies in any of the procoagulants can lead to a state where there is a propensity to bleed. The table below summarizes the major inherited bleeding disorders.

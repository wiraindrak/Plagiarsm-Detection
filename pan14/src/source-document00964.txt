Preferred Customer/Host Cards
Does anyone use thebooster.com prefered customer/host cards? Or have a similar program? What are your "rules" and/or requirements?

I think I will use that this year. I have one Customer I met in September who would have already filled it!

Yes, I've seen this card before. What are for your guidelines? I have a customer who would spend $100 or more in one purchase.

It boils down to them spending 195.00 with you before they get a free spice and they only get a punch or whatever you decide to do on what their product total is no shipping or tax. I am glad everyone liked the card

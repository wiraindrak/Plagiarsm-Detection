PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS FOR BUILDINGS
Options and integration:
of view there are two large areas of action: with a high degree of uncertainty as to the end result. , where this integration is considered as another aspect of the project, just like the structural, functional, or aesthetic requirements, and therefore having a greater guarantee of achieving acceptable integration.From the conceptual point
1. Integration into "built architecture",
2. Integration into "architectural projects"
it is possible to classify the different integrations into buildings according to the surface type expected to receive the photovoltaic installation: - Integrating the overlaid panels on the existing roof. - Forming a sealed roof with photovoltaic panels. -Integrating sloped panels using structures with simple supports. - Forming a surface parallel to the roof plane. - Integration into cantilevers and sun shades. - Integration into blind walls (ventilated fades). - Integration into curtain walls, glass skin, or large glazing. Â From the general typological point of view
1. Integration into sloped roofs:
2. Integration of photovoltaic panels into flat roofs:
3. Integration into fades:

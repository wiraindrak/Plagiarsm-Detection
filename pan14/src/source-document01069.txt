Bobcat pays as much attention to operator comfort as it does to digging performance. How does Bobcat provide superior comfort levels to other machines? We start by giving you the most cab space in the industry. In general, we provide 20% more interior cab volume than other brands. Whether you have size 13 or size 8 boots youl notice considerably more room at your feet, legs and knees, and more room for your arms and upper body. Bobcat has the largest cab entry/exit room in the market. We also provide a king-sized adjustable suspension seat for ultimate comfort during long hours of operation. An in-cab pattern selector allows you to change from an "excavator" to a "backhoe" control pattern from the seat of the cabo keys, special tools or panel removal is required. We didn forget the other cab details either. Features such as strategically positioned heat and air-conditioning vents direct air flow where you need it most. Other elements such as radio-ready cabs and fingertip-controlled auxiliary hydraulics all add up to increased operator comfort. Bobcat believes that there is a direct relationship between operator comfort and productivity. If you can comfortably stay in the seat longer, you will be able to get more work done.

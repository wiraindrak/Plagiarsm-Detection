We have a special program that allows foster children to take riding lessons at our rescue for no cost. These are some of our foster children in the program. Our volunteers Leslie & Gina assist these children with lessons under Genea's supervision. Both Leslie & Gina are very good with the children and devote several hours to our rescue.  All children learn to ride bareback before they learn western riding.

We have a special program at our Rescue for elderly horses who need a forever home.  Many elderly horse owners feel guilty just leaving their elderly horse out in a field or locked in a barn once that horse can only serve as a companion animal.A Forever Home
We will take your horse and care for it at our rescue the way it deserves to be cared for.  If you are interested in placing your horse in this program please and we can sit down and talk about what we can offer both of you. contact us

We had a wonderful horse donated to our rescue 07/07/07. His name is Charlie.
He is a (15) year old Quarter horse and he is kid broke. He will be used for a lesson horse at the rescue. He was donated by the Rice Family who live in Council Bluffs, Iowa. We want to send a special thank you to the Rice Family for their generous In-Kind donation to our rescue.

FARM  TOUR
 
During the winter, with enough chilling hours, the vines go dormant. Chilling hours necessary for adequate dormancy are those hours when temperatures are below 45 degrees F. Kiwifruit needs approximately 850 hours below 45 degrees F for proper dormancy. It is after the vines go dormant that they are ready to be pruned.1. DORMANT SEASON, BEFORE PRUNING
 
The way the vines are pruned will influence the next crop's yield in regard to both the number of pieces of the fruit that set and the size of that fruit.2. EMPLOYEES PRUNING
 
As winter turns to spring, the warmer awakens the dormant kiwifruit vines which have slept the cold winter months away. From the stick-like, barren vines appear little green buds which open to reveal an abundance of lush green leaves.3. FIRST GROWTH
 
With the warmer weather in May, the thick greenery is accompanied by many little flowers. The flowers of the female plants, once pollinated, will grow into the fuzzy-skinned, tasty kiwifruit.4. FLOWERING

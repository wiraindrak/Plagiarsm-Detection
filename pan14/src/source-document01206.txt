Kiwi Fruit Serving Ideas
Before describing kiwi fruit serving ideas, it is important to point out that kiwi fruits contain a substance, called "actinidin", which has a lytic effect on foods. This means that it can tenderize other foods such as salads and meat, and is the main cause of the "latex allergy" (which often manifests with itching in the mouth for allergic subjects).
It is generally a good practice to add kiwi fruit just before serving, to prevent actinidin from overly tenderizing other foods

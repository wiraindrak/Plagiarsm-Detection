LOL I didn't even notice this.  Look how fucking ridiculous it looks hahaha.  It's too early in the morning for this.... So if Muslim women are not allowed to swim wearing swimming wear with men, does this mean that Muslim men are not permitted to swim with non Muslim women wearing swimwear?
I didn't realize their women swam in the full body thing. Looks unpleasant.

Thats right.  Men aren't allowed to wear short swmming trunks (or even those ridiculous tight ones!) either.  I haven't been swimming since I was about 6 years old though.  BSc on my CV stands for Bronze Swimming Certificate.  Sorry couldn't resist the gag from Red Dwarf.    Yea, they do look freakishly similar.  Maybe they're twins.  The woman's arm looks fake too. :P

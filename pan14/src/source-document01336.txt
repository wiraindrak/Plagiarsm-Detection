BACILLUS thuringiensisvar. kurstaki
These bacteria have an effect on a large number of caterpillars, especially on young specimens. When the caterpillar is fretting, it devours the bacteria, which produce spores and protein crystals, so that the intestine wall becomes damaged and the metabolism disturbed. The jaws of the caterpillar get paralysed.

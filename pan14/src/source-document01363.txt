Additional Details
It was 1939. The end of the Great Depression neared. And, in Flushing Meadow Park, New York, the World's Fair shone like a beacon of hope. Among the most popular exhibits, the Road of Tomorrow at the Ford Expo Building. And the centerpiece there, the 1939 Ford Convertible Coupe, considered by many as the most beautiful Ford ever. Now, you can acquire the definitive die-cast re-creation of this classic. Hand-assembled from more than 225 separate parts, this sensational model is precision engineered with operable steering and suspension, spinning road wheels, doors that open and close, a rumble seat that opens, and windows that can actually crank up and down! Look at the interior and you'll find a fully instrumented dash, precise down to each gauge. Lift the hood and take in the intricacies of the fully detailed engine, with every wire and hose in place. Hand-painted in the official colors of the '39 World's Fair.

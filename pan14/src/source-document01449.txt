About Us
A good night's sleep is just as important to our overall health as diet and exercise. In addition to feeling refreshed and alert, sleep plays a key role in helping us fight disease. A lack of sleep may cause you to:
Lose concentration at work or school
Perform less efficiently
Respond to others with less patience and more irritability
Feel tired upon awakening and/or throughout the day
Unexpectedly nap at inappropriate times (at your desk, during a boring meeting, while eating, or in a theatre)
Have long term health consequences

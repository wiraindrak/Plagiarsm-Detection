Mineral & Fossil Clubs of Georgia
There are clubs(organizations) that are dedicated to the hobby of rock collecting, and are open to anyboby who has an interest in rocks. If you want to collect your own fossils, or dig your own minerals and gems, then these clubs are for you. These are organized clubs with contacts and insurance programs that conduct regular collecting field trips into quarries and private properties that would not grant you access as an individual. They also have programs to teach you how to cut your own stones and make your own jewelry pieces. These clubs are family friendly and offer great opportunities to enjoy the outdoors, learn new skills, and make many new friends who share your interests.

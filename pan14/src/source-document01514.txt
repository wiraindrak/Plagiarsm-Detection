MAD about butterflies & moths
In August 2008, Cicada Tree Eco-Place kick-started MAD Lessons for Wildlife. Kindly sponsored by Intel, and held in conjunction with the Singapore Botanic Gardens, 4 lessons on butterflies and moths were run at the Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden. MAD stands for Make A Difference, and it is hoped that all 63 children who attended this series of MAD lessons are carrying out the simple eco-actions they had pledged to do. Some suggestions were: 1. Don't kill butterflies and moths, and ask others not to do so. 2. Free butterflies and moths after reared caterpillars have undergone metamorphosis, so they can make friends and have more caterpillar babies! 3. Do not trap butterflies and moths. Observe them in the wild. 4. Protect caterpillars. Do not harm them. Kids learnt about the diversity of butterflies and moths in Singapore, the differences between the two, and their ecology: life cycle, where they live, what they eat, and what may eat them. There were museum specimens, as well as live caterpillars and pupae, to learn about. The children got to bring home an origami butterfly/moth they decorated themselves, a lovely wall-poster on butterflies, a button-badge, and a bookmark on which they could pledge to help butterflies and moths in their daily lives. Hi kids! If you attended Uncle Andrew’s session on butterflies and moths, and would like to share with us a story, idea or something which you learnt, please email us and we will post what you have to say on our blog!

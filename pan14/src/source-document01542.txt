The process of becoming a Pampered Chef consultant, although not difficult, involves a few basic steps. First, you will want to sign up to receive your kit. The kit start-up fee is $155.00O, for which you will receive all of the paper supplies that you will need, phone and online support information, and almost $500.00 in products. Orders generally take seven days to receive. That will be something you will want to let your customers know when you begin selling the products.
Next, you will want to familiarize yourself with the website and all of the features available to the Pampered Chef consultant. Being a good consultant involves knowing the products. The website provides special areas for consultants to find out about the products, little known facts, and special features that customers may find interesting.
Fans of the Pampered Chef products will buy from you once they become aware that you are now a consultant in their area. Research and talk to these people to build your network. Many customers of the Pampered Chef are repeat customers. Asking the people you already know if they would be interested in hosting a party is also a great way to build contacts.

 
MOVIE REVIEW (SPOILERS WILL COMMENCE):
is probably my sentimental favorite of all the movies thus far. It was the first one I saw, several years ago, back before I realized I'd gotten a movie and not a regular epiosde, now that I think of it. o_O There were a lot of things that stood out for me about this movie that I still can't forget.Toki o Koeru Omoi
This movie began rather slow for me, however. Seeing Sesshoumaru in Motohashi's style was a bit of a "whoa" moment for me. I'll admit that I am a bit fan of the style used in the movies, so it didn't bother me, it was just something I hadn't expected.
I'll always remember that the scene under the tree was one I just couldn't forget for a while, when he told her, "I need you, don't you understand that?" And the song "More Than Words," hehe, I was hunting for it on Amazon Japan the minute I finished hearing it. ;)
Sure I have my gripes; mainly about Sesshoumaru and Kikyou, since they were pretty much there just to make obligatory appearances and whatnot. Plus there were things like the "obligatory sit scene" and the "obligatory Miroku-Sango buttgrab" that kind of were a bit eye-rolling at the time. The villains aren't my favorite (that goes to Takemaru), and neither are the action sequences (that goes to Guren no Houraijima), but the Inuyasha/Kagome interaction is my favorite in this movie.
I haven't seen the movie in English (and really don't plan on it anytime soon), but in the Japanese version, Satsuki Yukino (Kagome) completely blew me away. Kappei Yamaguchi gets my nod as always. :P

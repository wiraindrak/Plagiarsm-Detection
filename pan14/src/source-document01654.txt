BRAZIL PICTURES
October 2006
We went to Brazil on a birding trip, but we arrived two days early to visit a former student of mine, Israel Felzenszwalb and his wife Miriam. Israel is a Professor at the State University in Rio de Janeiro. We celebrated my 80th birthday with them.
Then we birded in the mountains near Rio (Itatiaia), then Iguacu Falls, both the Argentina side and the Brazil side, and then the Pantanal, which is a large wet land in the West. I saw 367 bird species, and 244 of them were new for me (life birds). We were with Field Guides (17 days). Louis Bevier is a great leader.

April is National Poetry Month. To help celebrate this special occasion, the City of New York is sponsoring the 6th annual Poem In Your Pocket Day on April 17, 2008. This collaboration between the NYC Department of Education, the Department of Cultural Affairs and the Mayor’s Office, celebrates poetry by highlighting poetry events all month. New Yorkers are encouraged to carry a poem in their pockets and share with family, friends, coworkers and classmates. Public schools, after-school programs, and cultural institutions throughout the five boroughs will highlight poetry on this day through readings by poets, poetry workshops and specifically designed lesson plans. This year, the and the are working to bring John Waldman’s writing project to New York City.  Mr. Waldman takes published poems and places them inside envelopes.  He then writes the first line of the poem on the outside of the envelope and distributes the envelopes, so that participants may use the first line as a jumping off point to write their own poem.  At the end of the project, the participants share their poems with each other, along with the published poems.

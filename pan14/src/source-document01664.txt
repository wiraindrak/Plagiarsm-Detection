The most common form of von Willebrand disease (VWD) is reportedto be type 1, accounting for as much as 80% of reported cases.With prevalence estimates as high as 1.6% in the general population,upwards of 4.5 million Americans may be affected. Unfortunately,VWD type 1 is also the most difficult type to diagnose. Despitethe continuing progress in defining the genetic lesions responsiblefor VWD types 2 and 3, identification of the genetic determinantsof VWD type 1 remains elusive. Herein the phenomenon known asVWD is summarized, the challenges associated with the diagnosisof type 1 VWD are described, and the role of genetic researchin meeting these challenges is explored. The authors identifykey gaps in the current genetics literature and suggest newavenues for future research. Lastly, they explore the role ofnurses in this research and clinical endeavor. To the authors'knowledge,this review is the first to address these complex issues innursing research.

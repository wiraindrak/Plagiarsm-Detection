1392530kmAll planets rotate around the sun, it is the centre of our Solar System. The Sun exerts a powerful force of gravity attracting other bodies to it. This force is what keeps the planets orbiting the sun. The Sun spins around its axis once every 25 days. The sun is far larger than any other object in the Solar System. It occupies more than one million times as much space as the Earth, and its mass is 750 times that of all the solar system's planets, moons, and other bodies put together.
The Sun is an ordinary star, but it is the one that is nearest to us, that is why the sun is so bright. There are 9 planets that orbit around the sun; the inner planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, while Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are the outer planets, leaving Pluto as the smallest outermost planet. A common characteristic of the inner planets is that they have a rocky surface. The four outer planets are mostly composed of gases.

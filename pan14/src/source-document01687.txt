The national uproar over Rev. Rick Warren spilled into the streets of Atlanta during services for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday.
About 75 mostly gay and lesbian people stood across the street from Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Warren headlined the annual service, and chanted their disapproval for the selection and the California pastor’s views against marriage equality and other progressive causes.
The protest was the work of the Atlanta Black LGBT Coalition, GLBT ATL and other progressive groups who have spoken out forcefully against Warren’s inclusion in the events.

Let them dress like little girls
Modest doesn't mean frumpy
Little girls deserve to remain little girls as long as they like, without having to look like young women. Modest dresses can be simple or more fancy, and your little girls will love them. It's a joy to be a little girl, with fewer rules about the colors you wear, more ribbons and frills on your dresses, and everyone always thinking you look sweet as a spring flower. Modest dresses allow your child to remain a child. She'll let you know when she wants to start wearing clothes more "grown up"!

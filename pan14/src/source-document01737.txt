Piling it high and deep keeps your plants from drying out. Add it on every plant in your vegetable garden, and you can cut your watering down by almost half. It's always better to choose matter that will break down naturally. Using plastic or other inorganic material provides no nutrition and can actually block necessary water from getting to the roots.
Mulch - A Powerful Tool for the Self-Sustaining Organic Garden
Mulch is the best tool you have for a self-sustaining, organic garden with its own built-in fertilizer and moisture control.
Think of a forest scene with all those colorful red and yellow leaves lying on the ground.
But they don't just look pretty. They're providing those trees with nourishment and preserving moisture.
Follow the example of mother nature, and you'll take your vegetable patch to a whole new level with a self-sustaining garden that's strong and healthy.
Why Use It?
It's especially crucial to use it on your "thirsty" plants like squash and potatoes.
Also, by using material that is plant-derived, you'll be returning nutrients to your soil. Your plants will be stronger from the inside out, more resistant to disease and more fruitful.
It also protects the organisms in your soil and shields your plants from variations in soil temperatures. Think of it as a blanket that your plants can eat.
So What Kind Should I Use?
Leaves are one option, but they can mat and block out air and moisture.

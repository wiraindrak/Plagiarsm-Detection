COACHING HOUR CHRONICLES IS LATEST TITLE FROM OSP SHOOTING SCHOOL'S GIL & VICKI ASHWhen shotgunning instructors Gil and Vicki Ash began their SP Coaching Hourmonthly telesconference in 2001, it was an experiment to see if they could recreate the clubhouse magic that sometimes happens when shooters congregate outside the skeet field or range house, sharing what theye learned. As pioneers in competitive sporting clays and professional instruction in the U.S., there were no instructors from whom they could learn the sport, and they found the best way to improve their game was from the sharing of information among their fellow shooters. It wasn as efficient or focused as going to an experienced instructor some shooters just weren good at instructing others no matter how well they shot but the pooling of knowledge and experiences often proved beneficial. That concept, with the addition of professional instructors and a more coherent format, became the basis of the highly-successful SP Coaching Hour.The Ashes found the magic they sought, and the SP Coaching Houris now in its sixth year. Along with the hour of discussion and instruction, subscribers get a CD of the show so they can listen to it again. Now, Gil and Vicki Ash are offering the first year of SP Coaching Hourshows in book form, THE COACHING HOUR CHRONICLES, Book 1: Conversations in the Pursuit of Sporting Clays Excellence. Other seasons will follow.

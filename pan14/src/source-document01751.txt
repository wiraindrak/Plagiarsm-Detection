The Set Top Box
Our market leading IPTV set-top boxes is a high performance hybrid set-top box capable of supporting both standard and high-definition quality TV. Our hardware is also very flexible and can have at a minimum a terrestrial TV tuner and basic remote control to a Wifi enabled IPTV box coupled with PVR, smart card support and a small slick keyboard.
The set top boxes also have our IPTV middleware installed which allow us to update each subscriberâ€™s box with any new applications or software upgrades as and when is required. In addition, we are also able to remotely support and manage these boxes including monitoring what particular channels are viewed on a specific set-top box.
Because the set-top box is IP enabled, we are also able to open up various PC applications to be used on TV. Our PC on TV applications varies from web browsing and web mail, to instant messaging and video telephony. For office type applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, we use virtualisation technology to deliver these applications. This means that you no longer need to switch on your PC to check your emails or write a quick document to send to someone at work or a friend.

Raised Bed Vegetable Gardens: Plan 2 (3m x 3m Plot)
Raised bed vegetable gardens can be created in a surprisingly small space and will allow you the satisfaction of growing and harvesting your own fresh produce. This sample plan will fit in a space approximately 3m x 3m (10ft x 10ft) and, whilst it won't allow you to be totally self-sufficient, it will give you and your family the benefit of a good selection of fresh, tasty crops.
The trick with a small plot is to grow those crops that you actually enjoy eating. This sounds obvious but it is surprisingly easy to be lulled into thinking that you must grow, say, turnips, when you know that your family hates them! Grow small amounts of each type and you will really appreciate the pleasure of harvesting and eating your crops whilst they are young, sweet and tasty, without the hassle of coping with a glut.
Maximise the available growing space by planting the vegetables in blocks rather than rows and planting quick maturing salads and radishes between the slower maturing crops.
You can also make repeat sowings of any crops that are ready to harvest within a period of three months, for example carrots, peas and salad leaves, so that you have a succession of young crops for the table.
Make sure that each type of vegetable has the conditions it enjoys by using the simple system of crop rotation described in Sample Plan 1.

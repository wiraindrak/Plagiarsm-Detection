Mr Jerry Yang - what does Yahoo! stand for?
Yahoo!
Yesterday Jerry Yang, our CEO visited the Yahoo! European Headquarters in London. He held an all hands meeting at the No l Coward Theatre in London’s West End together with Toby Coppel our Managing Director at Yahoo! Europe.
They walked us through the “Big Plan” and did a QA session afterwards. One of the questions for Jerry in the session was.
If someone on the street would ask you: “What is Yahoo!, what does it stand for - what would be your answer?” Jerry replied “We want to be THE starting point for people using the web.”
Part of the message around the “new” Yahoo! was that the old mission statement was history now and to evangelize our newmission statementpurpose.
Yahoo! powers and delights our communities of users, advertisers and publishers - all of us united in creating indispensable experiences and fueled by trust.
It was good to get some of this information “first hand” and even so an all hands meeting is not the place where you cut the crap and get right to the tough questions it was great to see one of the guys who started it all taking on this challenge. Overall it felt like a good thing that our “new” CEO has a very personal relationship to the company and is determined to turn it around.

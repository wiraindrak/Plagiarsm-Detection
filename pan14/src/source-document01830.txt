The Pampered Chef
The Pampered Chef has been a loyal supporter of Feeding America since 1991. In that time, The Pampered Chef has raised nearly $13 Million to support our Network. As part of their "" campaign, Cooking Show guests are encouraged to "round-up" their orders to the next dollar or beyond. Money raised from these shows goes to the network member in that local area. Round-Up from the Heart
For the 16th annual campaign this year Pampered Chef is also offering a special Round Up from the Heart Trivet. For every trivet sold, The Pampered Chef will contribute $2 to Feeding America.
At The Pampered Chef, we have a vision that someday families all around the world will know the joy and rewards of gathering together in the tradition of family mealtimes. Since 1991, our coworkers, Consultants, and Cooking Show guests have supported Feeding America" through our annual Round-Up from the Heart campaign, raising more than $13 million. We are proud to be the first promotional partner of Feeding America" and through volunteerism, food drives and corporate contributions will continue our efforts to help end hunger throughout the United States.

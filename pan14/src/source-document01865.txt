Why is TACTUS designed the way it is?
Product Description
The TACTUS Keyboard is a standard QWERTY keyboard. However certain keys, those in a different colour, have special ridges along the edge.
 
The ridges have two shapes, they are either straight, as in the key O, or angled, as in the key P. An angled ridge signals to the finger that the key is a "corner" key. A straight ridge on the top edge of the key signals to the finger that the key is located on the top row. A straight ridge on the bottom edge of the key signals to the finger that the key is on the bottom row. The ridges on the keys are organised so that they form a virtual "box". There are two alphabetical boxes, one formed by the keys Q-R-V-Z in which the left hand moves, a second one formed by the keys U-P-?-M in which the right hand moves. There is also a numerical box formed by the keys 1-7-9-3 on the numerical keypad. The two alphabetical boxes comprise three rows of keys, the home row, the row above it and the row below it. Each row comprises four keys, one for each finger. The ridges on the keys are engineered to feel like tiny "walls" and because they are organised in a simple geometric pattern, they are easy to understand, learn and remember.The Ridges Form a Box

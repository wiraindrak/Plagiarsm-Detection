INDIAN DWELLINGS
Tom Blue Wolf and his crew have constructed a replica of a Native American hunting lodge from the 1600s. Built of wood logs and a mud cob reinforced by river reed, this type of structure was used by the Creek Indians and other woodland Indians of this area.
The hunting lodge and Plains Indian tepee (seen below) were premiered at Autrey Mill's 20th birthday party on September 14th and can now be seen by visitors to the Mill.
These American Indian dwellings will be used to teach about the history and peoples of this land, with special emphasis on how their survival was dependent on respect for and careful use of the environment.

Verbatim Comments:
 
*The ribs, baby back, were excellent and I would go back for sure.  The fries were excellent also.  Even though it is a long drive from Overland Park it is well worth the trip.  The place had been open for about 18 months.  The only down side was forced tipping.  Tips should be earned not required.
*I had the burnt end sandwich.  The meat was not as tender as I would have liked.  Beans and sauce were good.  A good value.
*This is the first "8" overall rating I've given in awhile.  A very nice find in NKC.  I had a Pulled Pork Sandwich and a side of Beans.  The Pulled Pork was good but not at the OK Joe's or Vermont Street level.  The Beans were served in a manly sized bowl and were pretty good.  The sauce was a little on the sweet side but also good.  The fries were cooked with the skins on and were also good.  I tried one of the ribs that were being passed around and it was a competition quality rib.  Excellent.  I'd go back for the ribs and I'm not generally a rib fan.  Nice atmosphere and good service.  Good sized portions and great value.  The only downside is that the Mighty Mo is north of the river!
*I liked Mighty Mo's.  I had a good ham sandwich, fries and beans.  The waitress was excellent and the service was outstanding.  I  had one of the ribs and it was very good.  If I was living in North Kansas City, I would go there on a regular basis.
*An excellent find!  They have been serving BBQ for 18 months or so but do a fine job.  The baby back ribs we had were great.  We ate in the back room, which turned out to be good because the whole front area was smokey (the cigarette kind).  More food on the $9.99 rib special than I could eat.   Check it out.

This year Audi will debut the reconstruction of a classic racing car from Auto Union, the famous “Silverarrow” Type D Dual Compressor from 1939. Goodwood’s Festival of Speed
The reconstruction of this racing car was not easy; it took four years to reconstruct the “new” Auto Union Type D. The car was entirely built in England by the specialist workshop Crosthwaite & Gardiner in East Sussex using some original parts and by Roach Manufacturing, near Southampton, who had the hardest task in hand, rebuilt the bodywork based only in a handful of historic photos.
The “Silverarrow” will be driven by Pink Floyd’s drummer . Nick has driven in the famous Le Mans 24h Hours in five occasions and has an impressive collection of classic racing cars. Had already driven an Auto Union car at last year’s Festival Audi couldn’t think of anyone else rather than Manson to drive its new master piece. Nick Mason

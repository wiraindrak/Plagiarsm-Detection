  Pampered Chef »Pampered Chef Party
All Pampered Chef consultants base the majority of their business upon sales generated at a Pampered Chef party; or Kitchen Show. Consultants use their skill and the professional-quality cookware, pantry items and tools, to showcase their wares and make sales. The show is a fun, light way for consultants to make money, and the consumer to view the products in action.
A Pampered Chef party generally has a theme; with all of the food cooked during the party focusing on that theme, and all of the guests eating the food. Some ideas for hosting shows are bridal expos, where customers may register online for gifts, enabling others to buy the products for them; but any location or event is a good venue for a Pampered Chef party since the food served is generally very good, and the products sell themselves through the demonstrations.
The start-up fee for becoming a Pampered Chef consultant is $155.00; for which you will receive a kit containing all of the product information, paperwork and training information necessary in addition to over $500.00 in products. Consultants state that they enjoy their work because the parties are fun and flexible, and the products are affordable, durable and high quality.

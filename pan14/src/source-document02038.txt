MLICETS has produced more 90 percentile test-takers than any other course for the GMAT out there. Compare MLICETS' 120 hours of goal-driven and skill-enhancing coaching for the GMAT with pitiful 18 to 27 hours offered by Kaplan, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, and Manhattan Review, and you can see why MLICETS is the best value for your GMAT prep time and dollars. Veritas Elite Prep course for the GMAT claims to offer 36 to 42 hours of in-class training but have been known to scale back the in-class hours if their instructors do not show up or cannot make it to teach the course. Also, Veritas ad in Craig's List for instructors states that 'no teaching experince required'. At least on one occasion, Veritas Elite Prep hired an instructor (Dawn MaGee) a week before the start of the in-class training and sent her the books used in the training courses.

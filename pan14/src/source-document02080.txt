Rick Warren's Statement on the Inaugural Prayer
December 19, 2008
Producer Robin Mazyck here with the latest on the controversy surrounding President-elect Barack Obama and Pastor Rick Warren.
As you know, both men have taken heat from both liberals and conservatives alike. Obama has been scrutinized for asking Warren to give the inaugural invocation on Jan. 20. Warren has been raked over the coals for agreeing.
Warren sent The Brody File the following statement about the issue:
I commend President-elect Obama for his courage to willingly take enormous heat from his base by inviting someone like me, with whom he doesn't agree on every issue, to offer the Invocation at his historic Inaugural ceremony.
Hopefully individuals passionately expressing opinions from the left and the right will recognize that both of us have shown a commitment to model civility in America.
The Bible admonishes us to pray for our leaders. I am honored by this opportunity to pray God's blessing on the office of the President and its current and future inhabitant, asking the Lord to provide wisdom to America's leaders during this critical time in our nation's history.

TCE Mission
Our Transfer Credit Department strives to serve the nations military and public service communities by offering a comprehensive review of all previous academic, military, civilian, and public education and training for potential credit toward degree and certificate programs at American Public University Systems (APUS) two member institutions: American Military University (AMU) and American Public University (APU). We established and created all the Transfer Credit polices and procedures with our unique student population in mind.  We make every effort to provide our students with the maximum amount of credit for their previous education and training.  We adhere to the standards of good practice set forth by our accrediting bodies while maintaining the overall integrity for which our degree and certificate programs are known.   All members of the Transfer Credit Department hope the information on these pages is helpful to you and look forward to helping you achieve your academic goals with APUS.

We love this bed because its so easy to assemble and provides lots of growing space. Use the 12" deep upper tier for tomatoes, potatoes or root crops; use the 6" deep lower level for lettuce, herbs, beans and peppers. Double-thick sidewalls add extra strength and help insulate plant roots. Plastic row cover hoops are included to support bird netting or season-extending garden fabric.
Easy, no-tool assembly
One level is 12" deep; the other is 6" deep
Will accommodate a variety of different plants
Thick sides provide insulation for roots

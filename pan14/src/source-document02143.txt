GMAT Prep Courses
When choosing GMAT study materials there are a few important things to consider. First, establish quality. There are countless companies and services that claim to be able to properly prepare you for the GMAT. Sadly, this is not the case. The majority of companies that offer GMAT study aides do not properly replicate the problems you will encounter on the GMAT. Furthermore, their GMAT practice test software falls well short of the adaptive nature and complex algorithm of the real test. There are, however, some very worthwhile options which are reviewed on this site.
Another important thing to consider is your budget. Gmat study materials can cost from next to nothing to a few thousand dollars. The key is to know your budget and choose the best materials accordingly. That could be anything from a few prep books to a full on GMAT course. Everyone must decide on an individual basis what is the most effective use of their time and money.
It is also essential to solidify a time frame in which to prepare for the GMAT. This will have a strong impact on what study options you choose to utilize. For instance, if you want to look into GMAT preparation classes, it would most likely be counterproductive to set the exam date a month away. GMAT courses run at specific times and it is not always possible to work them into a tight schedule. The point is to choose appropriate study aids given your time frame. This may seem obvious, but keep in mind your time frame is reliant upon admission deadlines, work, family etc- it can be hard to juggle it all, so take stock of your situation carefully when formulating a study plan.
There is a lot of lingo associated with the GMAT which can be hard to keep track of, especially if you are on a GMAT forum, for instance. Here are some common abbreviations.

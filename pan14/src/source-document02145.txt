Editorial Review
Union Place, formed at the union of Bloomingdale Road (Broadway) and the Bowery, previously extended from 10th to 17th Streets. After it was landscaped and reduced to its present size, it was renamed Union Square in 1832. The equestrian statue of George Washington by Henry K. Brown and John Quincy Adams Ward was unveiled in Union Square in 1856. These days, the vibrant , also known as farmers' market, takes place year-round. Farmers from across New York State as well as Pennsylvania sell their wares four times weekly, with Saturdays the busiest days. In warmer months, the steps near 14th Street are quite popular with students, and the northern end of the park has in recent years become a popular nighttime venue for skateboarders. The park has a dog run, a playground, and an outdoor restaurant/bar open in summer. Greenmarket

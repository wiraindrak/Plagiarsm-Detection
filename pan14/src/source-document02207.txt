Case study: PVC phase out in Nokia products and accessories
Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is a synthetic polymer material previously used in some Nokia products and enhancements especially as a charger and mobile phone headsets cable material. PVC has been at the centre of a controversial debate during much of the last decade. A number of diverging scientific, technical and economic opinions have been expressed regarding PVC and its effect on human health and the environment. The impacts of PVC being discussed are mostly concerning the use of certain additives and the management of PVC waste.
Nokia has concluded from the ongoing public debate that although the scientific evidence is controversial, grounds may exist for concern regarding the use of PVC in certain Nokia products, and has taken the precautionary decision to phase out PVC from its new terminal products and enhancements.
After reviewing alternative materials and technologies from different perspectives such as their safety, performance, reliability, availability and cost, several candidate replacements materials for PVC could be identified. Nevertheless, as more refined testing took place, some of the alternative materials proved unsuitable because of certain properties such as lacking flexibility or bad odor. These issues have since been rectified and the phase out of PVC has succeeded according to plan.

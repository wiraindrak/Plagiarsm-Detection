Interactive Format Outline
Does anyone have an outline for the new format? I'll go to CC in a minute to look as well but I wondered if anyone here had done one? I have a fabulous new consultant who lives too far out to make it to the Cook N Book so we're trying to find whatever help we can get for her. TIA

There is thread on here that I saw the other day where people posted their outline within their replies.

Thanks Jennifer. I found that thread but I was hoping someone had an actual outline typed up to share with new consultants. I'll have to work on something. Thanks

Yeah! I found this on CC. Thought I'd post it just in case anyone else needs it. Tips for a Winning Cooking Show! Choose the ideas you want to use in your Shows. Ask your host to guide guests as they arrive: “When your friends arrive, please tell them, ‘Come on in, drop your purse, and go to the kitchen. We’re going to have some fun making the recipe together!’” Set up your demonstration area as close to guests as possible. Bringing guests closer to you helps create instant rapport. Ask guests to wash hands (or use gloves) if they want to help out. Have guests stand around the demonstration area to make it easier for them to get involved. When you begin your Show, set your Clock/Timer for 40 minutes. When it goes off, you might say, “I’ve promised myself to keep it short for you, so that means I have about 5 minutes to wrap up. If there’s a product you want to know more about, be sure to ask me while we’re enjoying the recipe.” Ask questions that get guests sharing their experiences, e.g., “What’s one Pampered Chef® product no kitchen should be without?” Choose five products you want guests to try during the Show. Be sure to have them share what they liked about using the product. Read one small recipe step and ask someone to do it. While the guest is using the product for that recipe step, talk about it as you normally would, including booking and recruiting lines. When guiding a guest to use a product, give clear instructions so that they can feel successful. Pass around products that are not ’t part of the recipe to help guests experience their special features, e.g., the aroma of Pantry products, the flexible heads of our scrapers, or the “lock/unlock” closure on the Chef’s Tongs. Begin the checkout with a warm-up question like, “Did you enjoy yourself tonight?” Continue with an invitation to explore the business opportunity, ask if they’d like to host a Cooking Show, offer future customer care and ask for referrals, especially for the Wedding Registry. Ask everyone, every time, because then you won’t overlook anyone. Show appreciation and end your checkout on a positive note.

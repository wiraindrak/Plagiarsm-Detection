Raised Beds
Dramatically increase your vegetable, herb and flower production with our Raised Bed Kits and accessories! Studies have shown that raised bed gardens can yield nearly twice as much per square foot compared to standard gardening. Additional raised bed gardening perks include reduced soil impaction, better drainage and less garden pests to contend with. To extend the growing season and assist in hardening off delicate seedlings simply add a mini-cold frame to your raised bed kit. If you would prefer to build your own raised beds instead of using a kit we offer recycled plastic lumber in several sizes and PolyMax Build-it All stacking joints.

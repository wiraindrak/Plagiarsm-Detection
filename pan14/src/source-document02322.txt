The Shroud of Turin
I dont think the is really an image of Christ. But, the shroud controversy has got me thinking about a new business idea. Due to my normal to oily skin, I wear a herbal every night to keep my skin looking soft and clean. It also helps hide my blemishes and tighten my pores. Most of the Cardinals think Im gay for doing this, but I dont really care. My stylist tells me to ignore the ridicule and just focus on getting healthy skin. I think hes right. Anyway, I leave the clay masque on my face for about 30 minutes before cleaning it off with a warm Egyptian cotton hand towel. And when Im done, I can see a clay imprint of my face on my towel. I bet you that if I let it dry, I could sell these towels on eBay. What do you think? I can call it Wash Cloth of the Pope.

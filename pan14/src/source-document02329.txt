Article Diet & Weight Loss
When I started dieting in seventh grade, I wasn fat. Twiggy was the model of the year. Compared to her, we were all fat. This is where the relationship between dieting and fatness began.Does Dieting Make You Fat?

Weight loss is a $65 billion industry with projected growth of $40 billion over the next few years. In spite of these costly efforts against fatness, HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson says, "We've seen virtually a doubling in the number of obese persons over the past two decades More than half of U.S. consumers are trying to lose weight, yet, studies show that dieting results in weight gain.
It true. I focused on weight and dieting since the age of twelve and eventually expanded to over 300 pounds. I repeatedly lost weight and gained more back. This cyclic eating deprivation process, made me an expert on how it works.
There are two principles that drive this process. One is the Law of Attraction. Briefly stated, hat you focus on E-X-P-A-N-D-S Focus on weight; weight expands. I call this the new car phenomenon. Did you ever buy a new car? As soon as you leave the showroom, what do you see your car everywhere?
The other principle is the Law of Resistance. hat you resist persists what you push against pushes back. Waging war on drugs; poverty, and obesity is netting more not less.
Focusing on a diet expands attraction to food and eating. The more we resist certain foods, the more we crave them. What a dilemma!
Want a way out? Here are some tips.
Dr. Kelly Brownell, Director of the Yale Center for Eating and Weight Disorders reports that heavy people who are fit have lower risk of disease than thin people who are unfit. Research at http://obesitymyths.comFocus on health rather than pounds.
When you shower or bathe, take time to appreciate how every part of your body supports your life. Appreciate your strength, energy, stamina, mobility. If you give the qualities that are good and wonderful about your body attention, they will expand. Stop resisting and start accepting yourself.Focus on gratitude for your body rather than criticism.
or skipping meals. When you go for long periods without eating or restrict your calories, you gain weight. The body attempts to prevent starvation by retaining fat and lowering metabolism.Focus on eating well and regularly rather than skimping
Eating foods with high nutritional value, fresh, organic, raw or lightly cooked reduces hunger. When I started using high quality foods and supplements, persistent hunger disappeared. Empty calories in junk, processed or micro waved foods do not nourish cells, so you are always hungry.Focus on quality rather than quantity.
What kind of healthy eating fits your lifestyle? When I hungry I need things that are quick to grab, and I love hor`derves. Raw veggie rollups, hummus and pita wedges, fruit chunks, almond butter on celery, veggie juices, smoothies, protein bars, and snack packs (nuts, raisins, seeds on the run) work great because theye easy, tasty, energizing and satisfying for me.Focus on realistic ease rather than rigid shoulds.
What is your preferred eating pattern? What healthy, tasty, satisfying foods do you like? How can you make healthier choices that fit your life, so healthy eating is not a separate focus, like on again - off again dieting?
To live a long, healthy life, focus on what you want to expand health, mobility, energy - rather than what you don want to expand fat, weight, size. Focus on eating as a way to support and sustain the healthy lifestyle you want to enjoy, rather than a battle to attain some model of perfection.

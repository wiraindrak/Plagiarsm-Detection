Biggest Loser Challenges
I love the hit TV show, . I’ve always longed to be part of a supportive community helping me reach my weight loss goals. I’m also intrigued by the competitive aspect of the show, where you always seem to push harder when someone is counting on you. Not that I need a drill instructor yelling at me, but knowing my teammates need me to do well motivates me much more than going it alone. Biggest Loser
Last month I came across the web version of Biggest Loser, WeighIns.com. Right off the bat, I had my personal page live with photos and bio information. I also joined my first weight loss challenge and met some great people on my team. I feel so motivated for the first time! I also have my own personal diet journal, calorie counter, weight charts and access to all the community support message boards.
I was surprised that it was ! I’m used to sites like Sparkpeople trying to charge me at every turn, but everything at WeighIns is 100% free. You can start your own weight loss challenge or join someone else’s. Get over there today and get started on the new you!totallyfree

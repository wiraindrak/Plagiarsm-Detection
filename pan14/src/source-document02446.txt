Care products for PVC-U windows and doors
Even a PVC-U window needs to be looked after to ensure it will last for many years. Sch co has developed a comprehensive range of care products according to the demands placed on white and foiled window profiles.
Cleaning your PVC-U windows
To clean your Sch co PVC-U windows, we recommend that you use our PVC-U cleaner for white PVC-U from the "EasyCare range. Foiled PVC-U windows are protected from weathering and ageing by a permanent second, colourless acrylate film. The best way to look after these foiled profiles is to use the Sch co EasyCare PVC-U cleaner for foiled PVC-U. The mini care kit, for example for white or foiled windows, contains a PVC-U cleaner, a gasket cleaner and a fittings spray, to ensure that your PVC-U windows and doors have a long life.
Advantages of the Sch co EasyCare care products
The gaskets in your Sch co PVC-U windows remain supple, moisture-repellent and effective in maintaining weathertightness over a long period of time. General household residue, deposits from industrial waste gases and car exhaust emissions as well as heating oil residue can be quickly and effectively removed using these cleaners. The Sch co EasyCare care products are hypoallergenic, antibacterial, antistatic, non-flammable, biodegradable and therefore environmentally friendly.

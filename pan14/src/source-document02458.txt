  Sake
Sake, often called the "Drink of the Gods" by the Japanese, is a beverage created from rice, water, koji, and yeast, usually with an alcohol content of 15%-16%, just slightly higher than that of an average red wine. Sake is brewed like a beer (not distilled), but it is served and enjoyed like a fine white wine. Premium sake is usually served lightly chilled, while lower grades of Sake are usually served hot. The sake that The Wine Country carries is more specifically referred to as "ginjo" sake -- chilled, ultra-premium, pure rice Sake -- not the boiled, cheap stuff that has (unfortunately) been served to Americans in small, ceramic carafes at sushi bars for decades.The Wine Country's Super Premium Sake Selection.
In terms of grade or quality, this category represents approximately the top 12% of all Sake produced in Japan. They are rare (80% of brewers' production is consumed locally), and they are more expensive than sake produced in the U.S. or Japanese sake produced by the mega-breweries.

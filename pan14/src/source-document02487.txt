Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disorderof small vessels that is associated with deficiency of the vonWillebrand factorcleaving protease, ADAMTS13. The presenceof anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies is considered a factor predisposingto relapses. Despite close monitoring and intensive plasma treatment,in these patients acute episodes are still associated with substantialmorbidity and mortality rates, and the optimal therapeutic optionshould be prevention of relapses. This study was conducted ina patient with recurrent TTP due to high titers of ADAMTS13inhibitors, who used to have 2 relapses of TTP a year. The studycompared the standard treatment plasma exchange with rituximab.Results documented that plasma exchange had only a small transienteffect on ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitors; on the contrary,prophylaxis with rituximab was associated with disappearanceof anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, a progressive recovery of proteaseactivity, and it allowed the patient to maintain a disease-freestate during a more than 2-year follow-up.

Earth Changes
The focus for the lessons on Earth Changes (earthquakes, landslides and volcanoes) were targeted to the Science and Technology for Children (STC) unit Land and Water and the Full Option Science System (FOSS) unit Landforms. The lessons the teachers developed were designed to take advantage of the opportunity to integrate reading and writing into science.
The lessons were piloted by the teachers who participated in the ACTS program. Revisions were made based on teacher feedback.
The Earth Changes lessons will help students understand how earthquakes, landslides and volcanic eruptions change the Earth's surface. We suggest these lessons fit at the end of the unit.
If you are an individual teacher, check with your Materials Science Resource Center (if your school district has one) to see if the Earth Changes lessons are already in the kit. If you do not have a Materials Science Resource Center, here are the resources you will need:

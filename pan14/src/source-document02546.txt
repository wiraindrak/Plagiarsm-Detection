Membership Benefits
Members are entitled to all that is offered by the ISSF: events, meetings, contests, prizes, awards, nominations, and networking. Members also benefit from a monthly newsletter, full of important information, tips, publications, internet sites and outside expositions.
Individual membership in the ISSF is $60 annually. Spouse or significant other costs an additional 25% of the annual dues (per the By Laws). The first meeting is free. Since we are a non-profit, membership fees provide for our expenses. Our monthly newsletter, guest speakers and members provide valuable information and resources for fellow inventors. Many successful contacts are made networking after our meetings. The monthly newsletter is filled with tips, useful websites, articles and upcoming events. The ISSF has hosted exhibits, seminars, workshops, field trips, fundraisers and children's programs. Â

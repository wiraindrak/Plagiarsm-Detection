  NAVSTAR GPS/Block I - Specs
Technical Specifications
The GPS satellite vehicle numbers (SVN) 1 through 11 are designated as Block I. The Block I satellites are/were positioned in the same orbital planes as the Block II, but at an inclination angle of 63 degrees. Block I consisted of the original concept validation satellites and reflect various stages of system development. Lessons learned from the 11 satellites were incorporated into later blocks.
In 1974 Rockwell International was awarded a contract to build 8 Block I satellites. In 1978 the contract was extended to build an additional 3 Block I satellites.

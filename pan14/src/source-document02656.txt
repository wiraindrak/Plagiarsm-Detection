Tazo® Tea
Tazo has its genesis in 1994 when Steve Smith, a veteran with more than 30 years experience in the tea industry, set out to breathe new life into the then dull tea category.  He sought to dispel the myth that tea was weak and matronly.  Tazo has since emerged a leading specialty tea brand built upon core values of artistic blending and captivating flavours.  At Starbucks, we handcraft a brilliant range of hot filtered black & green teas and herbal infusions, iced shaken teas and herbal infusions, and tea lattes.  We also offer retail packaged teas to enjoy at home.  Explore  to learn more. www.tazotea.com

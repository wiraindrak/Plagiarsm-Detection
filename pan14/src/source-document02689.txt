VLDL Cholesterol: Understanding Cholesterol and Lipoproteins
To better understand the role of VLDL cholesterol, it may be helpful to know a little more about cholesterol and lipoproteins. 
 
Cholesterol is a soft, waxy substance found in all the cells of the body. Your body needs some cholesterol in order to work properly. To get to all of the cells, cholesterol needs to travel through the bloodstream. However, because cholesterol is a fat, it separates from the blood similar to the way that oil separates from water.
 
To prevent this from occurring, proteins form a shell around the cholesterol, creating a "cholesterol complex." It is then released into the bloodstream and travels to where it needs to go.
 
A protein that is linked to cholesterol to form this cholesterol complex is called a "lipoprotein." VLDL is one of several lipoprotein complexes. Other lipoproteins include:
 
Low density lipoprotein (), the "" LDL bad cholesterol
Chylomicrons, the major transporter of in the blood triglycerides
Intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL).

Robb D. Smith, an experienced Mobile Disc Jockey/Entertainer in Central Florida since 1987, after brief stint in radio, and being a people person foremost Robb began his career as a $40 a job part time DJ with a large multi-system company in the Tampa Bay area in 1987.  He quickly moved up the ranks from sales, to manager, to Vice President of Operations, and then purchased the company in 1994 for over three hundred thousand dollars.
With his staffs help and assistance, the company grew to be one of the nations largest, and expanded to several locations in Florida.  The DJ training he employed in his successful business, he expanded upon in 1997 and offered it to anyone interested in improving their skills.   He sold his business in 1998, but retirement did not suit him.  He began attending conferences and symposiums and began expanding FAME to more prominent national level.
A prominent speaker at national DJ conventions, in both Las Vegas, and Atlantic City and the WEDJ Cruise, his expertise comes from many years of experience in running a large multi system of 36 units to being a single operator, and now a lucrative 10 DJ operation currently in Tampa .  FAME has grown because of the contributions from DJ's all over the U.S.  Robb takes very little credit for it's success.
Appointed Education Director for the National Association of Mobile Entertainers in 2002, and a contributing writer published in industry magazines, an expert in DJ sales training and moderator at conventions are just a few of Robb's recent accomplishments   One of Robb's favorite quotes.
"FAME can teach you something, but Robb is quite sure you can teach FAME something also."

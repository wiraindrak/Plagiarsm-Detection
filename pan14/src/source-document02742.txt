According to some gardeners, the ideal raised bed is a trim rectangle, attractive and easy to tend. Our Vermont-built raised beds are made of durable, rot-resistant red cedar. Copper corner caps further inhibit rot, and give the whole bed a handsome, finished look. We offer a 3' x 3' size to use in smaller areas or in combination with the larger 3' x 6' bed. Both sizes are 10-1/2 inches deep, perfect for deep-rooted crops. When looks and durability count, these are the raised beds to use.
Raised beds require no digging
Cedar is naturally rot-resistant
Hardware included, even matching copper nails for the copper caps

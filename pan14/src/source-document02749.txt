Galvanised steel hoops slot into the corners of the Timber Grow Bed to create a very strong framework onto which you can attach support wires, string etc to support climbing plants. Or to create a huge cloche simply cover the frame with clear polythene or garden fleece. During the summer months you can cover the hoops with netting to protect your crops from butterflies (so caterpillar damage) or birds. These strong hoops provide you with loads of possibilities for making even greater use of your Timber Grow Beds.
Supplied as a pack of two hoops
Made from (19mm) diameter galvanised steel
Height 39 (100cm)
TOP TIP
When covering with material youll need a piece at least 3 metres x 3 metres to cover the hoops, The cover can be held securely to the frame using our Material Fixing Clips.

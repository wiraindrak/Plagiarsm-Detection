The Virginia (DMV) is the state agency responsible for such duties as licensing drivers, registering and titling vehicles, regulating traffic, and ensuring the safety of motor vehicles on the highways. Department of Motor Vehicles
Until 1942, many of the DMV's duties were handled by police officers. Now, the state police, the courts, the DMV, and other agencies work together to enforce all of the laws surrounding the ownership, taxation, and operation of motor vehicles for personal and commercial use.
Here are some highlights in the department's evolution:
In 1906, the first Virginia law requiring automobiles to be licensed and registered was passed.
In 1910, the General Assembly passed acts to improve highways with motor vehicle registration fee money.
In 1919, the Automobile Acts were passed, which gave the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles the powers of sheriff to enforce motor vehicle laws. This was the beginning of the Virginia State Police. The Acts also created the first titling laws for motor vehicle owners in Virginia.
The Division of Motor Vehicles was created in 1923 as a separate department of the state government. Enforcement powers were also transferred to this new department.
In 1928, legislation was passed to license drivers in Virginia. They now had to be tested to determine their ability to drive. Vehicle safety inspections were also placed under the supervision of the state at this point.
In 1942, the General Assembly eliminated the existing Division of Motor Vehicles and created two separate agencies: the Department of State Police and the Department of Motor Vehicles.
Today, there are nearly 7 million people living and working in Virginia, and most of them are licensed drivers. The DMV has grown from a tiny department into a large state agency with offices throughout the state and the ability to accommodate common transactions online.

 
Fresh From The Farm In Dutchess County, New York
Located in the heart of the Hudson River Valley mid-way between New York City and Albany, our county has more than 650 farms encompassing about one-fifth (or 20 percent) of the area’s total acreage.  Together these small, mostly individual- and family-owned farms – which include dairy, fruits, vegetables, nurseries and greenhouses, hay, horses and other agricultural crops and products – enrich our area in many ways.
Relax, explore, experience and enjoy our bucolic farms, vineyards and food markets.  Sample our mouth-watering restaurants.  Visit our quaint shops and galleries.  And stay overnight in our local B&Bs which serve homemade fare using the freshest, local ingredients.
Local farms not only add to the quality of life in Dutchess County, they also generate millions of dollars in annual sales and provide a direct economic benefit to our area – all while supplying a variety of fresh, great-tasting foods and beverages to chose from.
When you think farm-fresh goodness, “Think Dutchess!”

Bacon for the Family or a Crowd Reviewed:Dec. 28, 2008
I started off following the original instructions but ended up increasing the temperature to 375 and cooking the bacon for about a half hour. The mess was minimal and I'll definitely do this again, possibly upping the temperature to 400 next time.

Lemon Poppy Seed Loaf Reviewed:Dec. 6, 2008
The recipe gets 5 stars for taste but 4 stars for apperance. I doubled the recipe and made 4 loaves. The loaves didn't rise much and they sunk in the middle slightly. It may have been my mixing technique so I'll give them a try again another time.

I didn't use the onion soup mix but used real onions and garlic in with the wine. The meat became very tender. I made gravy with flour and it was delicious. Will definitely make this again.

Curry Pumpkin Soup Reviewed:Oct. 12, 2008
I made a combination of this recipe and the other recipe for pumpkin soup on this site. I added onions, celery and garlic, sauted and then did a roux of flour followed by homemade chicken stock. I tasted it before adding the soya sauce and cream and it has a nice kick. A nice hearty soup!

I found the cookies tasted okay but the batter didn't drop well. I used a scoop and the cookies didn't flatten at all and kept the original half circle shape. Not a keeper but not horrible.

Nova Scotian Hodge Podge Reviewed:Jul. 19, 2008
I give a 4 star but with some modifications. In my area of Nova Scotia, the key ingredients are new potatoes, fresh green and yellow beans, and new/baby carrots. It is called hodge podge because you can put an assortment of veggies in it. I always add brocolli and cauliflour, sometimes zucchini, or any other fresh veggie that strikes your fancy. For added flavour I cook the veggies in chicken or turkey stock, with added water if necessary. Barely cover the veggies with the stock/water, and start with the veggies that take the longest to cook first and adding the quick cookers like the beans last which essentially steam on top of the broth. The vegetables should be tender crisp and I would think the times in the receipe would overcook the veggies. Real cream and butter makes the meal decadent but skimmed evaporated milk can be used too if trying to cut back on fat & calories (and costs). There is no need to thicken with flour. The consistency is like a thin chowder as opposed to a thickened sauce or soup. Some people like to add corned beef or cooked ham from a boiled dinner to it to make it an even heartier meal. Whatever version you try, enjoy!!

Tabbouleh III Reviewed:May 5, 2008
This is a really good and easy recipe. I reduced the oil and lemon juice to a 1/4 cup of each and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. Tastes delicious!

Very tasty and healthy. I doubled the recipe and only put in one cup, of brown sugar, accidentially missing 1/3 cup. They still tasted great.

Golden Sweet Cornbread Reviewed:Mar. 30, 2008
I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be delicious as is. I baked it in a Pampered Chef Deep Dish Baker and it came out perfect. Let the bread sit a few minutes before cutting. It will be firmer and less crumbly than if cut right out of the oven.

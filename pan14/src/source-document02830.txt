MISSION:
Welcome to the Hoboken Women's Network. Our mission is to bring together the bright, fun, amazing ladies of Hoboken for a great time. We aim to form a supportive network, but we promise to spare you from any strange attempts at female bonding, such as holding hands and singing Kumbya...we're more fun than that!
WHO WE ARE:
The Hoboken Women's Network is just that...a network of women living in Hoboken from all walks of life, backgrounds, occupations and interests who come together relax, chat and enjoy a ladies' evening out. This group is perfect for professionals, stay at home moms, women who have recently moved to Hoboken, or those who have been here for 20 years! We open our arms to the unemployed, the entrepreneurs, ladies younger than 25 and those older than 55 (and everyone in between!).
Come alone or bring a friend, either way, you'll leave with a network of new friends you'll want to reconnect with at the next event.
We look forward to seeing you at the next event. Please pass this on and invite your female friends in Hoboken!

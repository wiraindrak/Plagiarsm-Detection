One of my favs: I just make enough for me.. or more if needed for others Italian Noodles Modified form a real Italian dish Angel hair pasta Large can of black olives real grated parmesian cheese milk, just a little 1-2 eggs Cook the angel hair pasta and drain, add back to pan. Add a little milk, break an egg or two into the noodles and stir over low heat until egg is done. (it mixes with the milk and makes a custard). Toss in sliced black olives and add parmesan cheese to taste. Stir Eat!You can add frozen english peas or broccoli florets to the water before adding the pasta if you want. It is best just bu itself. I will get to recipes for shows later.

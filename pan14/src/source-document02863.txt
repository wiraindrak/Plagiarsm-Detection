Warren, Obama, and McCain
August 18, 2008 by strengthenedbygrace
If you missed the forum hosted by Rick Warren with the presidential candidates this site has video and a link to the full transcript.
Of most interest to me was how the candidates would respond on the issue of abortion. Warren asked both candidates when a baby gets human rights. McCain answered at conception, and Obama said answering that question is above my pay-grade. If that doesnt sum up the difference between these two men on the abortion question, then I dont know what does. (Part 4 of the video link–3 minutes into it)

Excellent debate. Thank you RIck. I wasn’t sure who to vote and this cleared my decision. McCain is clearly ready for presendient–He is clear, strong, conviction. Also top thing he is Christian, faith. His time in prison alone could not strenghtn him. THrough this clip we see he is true, genuine & real…the real person we need. I now am supporting his campaign. Thank You again Rick, You’ve done a great job with the questions. It was non-biased and people can view for themselves of who is Genunine, not fake & superficial.

Recent surgery (most common following ),neurologic disorders, serious infections, cardiorespiratory insufficiency, metabolic disturbances, and drugs that disturb colonic motility (e.g., anticholinergics or narcotics) contribute to the development of this condition. coronary artery bypass surgery [7] [2] [8]

It usually resolves with conservative therapy stopping oral ingestions, i.e. and a , but may require decompression which is successful in 70% of the cases. A study published in the showed that is a potent pharmacological way of decompressing the colon. According to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), it should be considered prior to colonoscopic decompression. The use of neostigmine is not without risk since it can induce bradyarrhythmia and bronchospasms. Therefore atropine should be within immediate reach when this therapy is used. nil per os nasogastric tube [2] colonoscopic New England Journal of Medicine neostigmine [1] [8] [1] [2] [3]

It is a serious medical disorder and the mortality rate can be as high as 30%. The high mortality rate is likely a measure that this syndrome is seen in critically ill patients, rather than this syndrome being in itself lethal. [8]

The focus for the lessons on Fossils were targeted to the Science and Technology for Children (STC) unit Rocks & Minerals and the Full Option Science System (FOSS) unit Earth Materials. The lessons the teachers developed were designed to take advantage of the opportunity to integrate reading and writing into science.
The lessons were piloted by the teachers who participated in the ACTS program. Revisions were made and then piloted in classrooms across Washington State.
The Fossils lessons will help your students understand that fossils provide evidence of plants, animals, and environments that existed long ago as well as understanding that plant and animal species change over time. We suggest these lessons fit just after Lesson 3 in the Rocks & Minerals (STC) unit and at the end of the Earth Materials (FOSS) unit.
If you are an individual teacher, check with your Materials Science Resource Center (if your school district has one) to see if the Fossils Lessons are already in the kit. If you do not have a Materials Science Resource Center, here are the resources you will need:

The Arid Land Ecology Reserve: Geology
The Columbia Basin geologic province covers about 50,000 square miles of what is now southeastern Washington and adjacent parts of Idaho and Oregon. The Basin is underlain by vast lava flows of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Today, those flows and the ground surface above them slope toward the Pasco Basin, where two large rivers, the Snake and the Yakima, enter the Columbia.
The Hanford Site is located at the low point of the Pasco Basin and is bounded to the southwest, west and north by large anticlinal ridges that extend eastward from the Cascade Mountain Range and terminate within the Pasco Basin. Hanford is bounded to the east by the Columbia River and the steep, imposing, west-facing white bluffs of the Ringold Formation. Beyond, gently rising basaltic lava flows lead into the Palouse country of eastern Washington.
Elevations within the Hanford Site range from about 105 meters (345 feet) above sea level to 1093 meters (3586 feet) at the crest of the Rattlesnake Hills. That portion of the ALE Reserve below about 366 meters (1200 feet) and most of the remainder of the National Environmental Park was covered by floods associated with the glacial Lakes Missoula, Columbia, Spokane and similar ice-marginal lakes, and by glacial meltwaters (Brown 1970).
The fauna present during the late Pleistocene epoch indicate the presence of extensive grasslands. Mammoth, bison, horses, deer and other unidentified species were all present (Fry 1969). Effective precipitation apparently was greater than now, in order to support the vegetation that was grazed or browsed by these populations of large animals. The mammoths, bison and horses are believed to have become extinct between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago, disappearing shortly after the time of the last glacial lake Missoula floods (Brown 1970).

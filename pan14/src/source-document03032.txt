The School of Management offers a non-credit refresher course for the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT). An intensive preparation for the graduate school entrance examinations, the course covers quantitative processes related to the GMAT and all graduate professional school entrance examinations.  Actual GMAT questions will be used in class, and instruction will be geared toward the computerized GMAT test. This course is designed to help you prepare for the quantitative portion of the GMAT, which is the part most people struggle to prepare for and do well on.
Classes focus on quantitative only. Participants will be asked to do a diagnostic test online or here at one of our computer labs, BEFORE the start of classes, and should bring their test result to the first class for your review. 
*This weekend session is an intense and limited preparatory session. It is intended for those individuals that have been preparing and studying diligently or are planning to take the GMAT again to increase their score. Please note that AMEX and Discover will not be accepted for payment for any GMAT Prep class.

Re: Yahoo Groups
I'm actually the farthest south and west in my (former) team. My former AD didn't plan a meeting for this month, so someone under her downline director set it up. And there's a person on that team who apparently can't ever find (or won't use) a babysitter. So the meeting has to be at her house if we expect her to attend. And then my sister consultants and myself are just "invited guests" at the meeting, since we're no longer in the same genealogy since our director relinquished and we rolled up to a NED's first line. Trust me - I'd LOVE to have a meeting in our neck of the woods! People never seem to believe me when I tell them that I drive 45-100 miles round trip for meetings, depending on the location.

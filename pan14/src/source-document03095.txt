Premium burger restaurant franchise launches in Ireland
The Counter, a premium burger restaurant, has entered the Irish market with the launch of its first outlet in Dublin. The Counter franchisee Niall Fortune, who has over 25 years of experience in the restaurant business, owns and operates the first Irish outlet which is located in Dundrum. Originally founded in the USA in 2003, The Counter not only allows customers to choose from six signature burgers but also allows them to create their own. Through its 'Build Your Own Burger' option customers can choose from 312,120 possible combinations to make their perfect burger. Founder Jeff Weinstein says: "We're giving the power back to the customer. We're putting the choice in their hands. Ultimately, they're responsible for what goes on their burger. They own that burger. It has their name on it." The Counter concept has been well received in the USA and it has been highly rated by GQ Magazine in their list of the '20 Hamburgers You Must Eat Before You Die!' and The Oprah Winfrey Show highlighted The Counter as the "best burger" in America. Franchisee Niall adds: "Ever since we announced The Counter was in the works, we've had an increasing number of inquiries from local residents who have visited The Counter's original restaurant in Santa Monica and can't wait for us to open in Dublin. Having that level of excitement before we open our doors is a great feeling and if it keeps up as we think it will, The Counter is going to be around for a very long time."

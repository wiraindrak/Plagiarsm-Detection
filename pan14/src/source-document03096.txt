Programs, Task Forces, and Other Enforcement Activities
Welcome to the CHP Programs and Task Force page.
Our motto is "Safety, Service, and Security." Read about how we provide those features to Californians here - through active programs, task forces, community outreach, and communication. We take a pro-active stance against crime, trying not only to protect our public, but by showing the public how to protect themselves. We promote safe driving for all ages, we have programs designed to teach kids about the dangers of drugs and alchohol, and we provide support to victims of crimes. Help us keep our roads and highways safe. Do your part by driving safely, and reminding others of their responsibilities on the road. Volunteer for one of our Community Outreach programs. Or be a mentor for young adult. California's safety is everyone's responsibility.

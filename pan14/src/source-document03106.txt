Convex Solid Fence
The style provides both privacy and good looks.Convex Solid
Red cedar is normally used for the pickets and rails, treated pine posts are used to cement in the ground. The beauty and weather resistance of red cedar combined with the rot proof characteristics of CCA treated pine posts makes this fence a winner both in appearance and durability. The treated posts are used so they can be set in concrete to resist high winds. Matching cedar posts are not used, because the concrete would rot out the normally rot resistant cedar prematurely. The fence is built with no space between pickets and will shrink to leave a 1/8" to 1/4" space between the pickets. The vertical boards are attached with aluminum nails, which will not rust and leave unsightly stains, ruining the cedar as years pass by. If left to weather, the green tint of the posts will eventually match the graying of the red cedar. Stain can be applied, but the cedar does require a lot.It is also available in CCA treated pine.
Advantages:
Provides privacy, attractive appearance and durability of red cedar.
Disadvantages:
High wind load as with all tall solid fence styles. Has a neighbor side (the good side) and your side (the post and rail side) as opposed to some styles that are the same on both sides.

Solar Dish-Stirling - the world's most efficient solar technology
SSPI GmbH is currently in the process of setting up a platform to develop, produce and market 10kW and 25kW Solar Dish Stirling systems. The planned mass production of 10kW and 25kW Solar Dish Stirling systems will make this technology commercially viable and open up lucrative new markets around the world. SSPI has made it its goal to become one of the leading suppliers of Solar Dish Stirling systems.
SSPIs Dish Stirling systems can be used for both decentralised and centralised solar energy supply. With a power output of between 10kW and 25kW per system it is possible to connect several systems together and create a "farm" and supply anything from 10kW to several MW. This means that the dish stirling system is suitable for a wide range of applications.

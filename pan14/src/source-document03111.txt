He tries to make his photos artistic, rather than pure records. Even when the grass is wet, he can be seen on his knees trying to get the best angle. Having taken similar shots to others whilst behind the fence line at air displays, he now spends his time with aviation minded people helping them to enjoy Tiger Moth pleasure flights, and at de Havilland Moth Club events. He also loves taking photos of Yaks in formation, but that is another story. His favourite photographer is Charles E Brown.ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPHER:

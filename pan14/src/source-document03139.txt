Janeway was born in Indiana, Earth. As a girl, she took ballet lessons and performed the "Dying Swan" at age six. She hiked the northern rim of the Grand Canyon with her father when she was nine years old. At the age of twelve she walked home in a thunderstorm over seven kilometres because she lost a tennis match.
Her mother worked as a mathematician and her father was a Starfleet Admiral and they both influenced Janeway when choosing an occupation. Because of her special interest in science and mathemathics she joined Starfleet Academy and graduated as a science officer. Early postings include serving as the science officer on the Al-Batani under Admiral Owen Paris, who later recommended Janeway for a command position, and as commander on USS Billings. She was given the command of in 2371 and was presumed lost after disapperaing during a mission to the Badlands in 2371. U.S.S Voyager

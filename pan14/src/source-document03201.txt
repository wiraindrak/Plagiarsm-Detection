Polyphemus Moth
These are lovely moths. The caterpillars live in our oak trees around our house. I have read that they will eat maple and oak, we have both in our yard but my daughter actually found a coccoon under our oak tree so we know they live in the oak tree.
My son caught a female moth before she found a place to lay eggs. So we kept her and she laid eggs in the jar and they were fertile so the eggs did hatch.The eggs are very large in comparison to the silkworms eggs, about the size of the ball on top of a stick pin.
Raising the polyphemus caterpillars is very different from the silkworm in some respects. The main one is they do need water! We lost many caterpillars because I wrongly assumed that they would get their water form the oak leaves as had the silkworms from their mulberyy leaves. Donâ€™t make that same mistake you must mist them so they can drink the droplets off the leaves. After we figured out why they were dying they were more enjoyable to raise. They become quite large and have the most beautiful green. They also spin the wild silk coccoon. They are much slower at their eating than the silkworms so you will need to get less leaves and change them often.
If you do raise the moths, when you let them go make sure to at night because they are a meaty meal to all sorts of predators, especially birds.
I have a booklist on my silkworms pages

Orthodontia Program
Children with physical handicaps who are eligible for the California Children Services (CCS) program may receive physical and/or occupational therapy through the Medical Therapy Unit (MTU). Therapists specialize in pediatric treatment and equipment issues. The goal of therapy is directed toward attaining maximum function within the limits of the child's capabilities.
The Medical Therapy Program is a cooperative effort of state and local departments of health and education. MTU's are located in public schools, where space and therapy equipment are provided by the county's schools. The main MTU is located on the Meadow View School campus at 2665-A Dutton Meadow Avenue in Santa Rosa. Additional satellite sites for therapy are located in central Santa Rosa and Cotati.
The program accepts children with from birth to age 21. Referrals to the program can be made by parents, private physicians, specialty clinics, school nurses, hospitals, or other agencies. There is no charge for the occupational and physical therapy services. Financial assistance is available, for those that qualify, to help pay for durable medical equipment and bracing needs. eligible conditions

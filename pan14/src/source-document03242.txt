     Sitting majestically just to the north of our vineyard is Mt. St. Helena, a 4300 foot cluster of peaks made up of volcanic material.  It is from the eons of erosion of Mt. St. Helena that the alluvial plain, on which Work Vineyard sits, was formed.
The rhyolites, tuffs and other rocks from the mountain have been eroded and washed down over the centuries to form the soils that nourish and support our grapes. Our vineyard, at only 3 acres, has two soil types, but each bestows its own unique character.   The northwest corner is more gravelly and rocky Bale loam and provides a mineral and washed-stone character, while the predominant soil, being Dublin clay loam, enhances the fruit with floral and spices the real essence of the grapes. the grapes.

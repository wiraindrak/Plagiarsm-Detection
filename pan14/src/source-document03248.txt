Reality spittin in our face cant trace the babies father a mother borns under pressure streets speak heat when the child doesnt measure up to societies terms no space to learn just yearn for what their achin empty bellies burn for sure its reality but the cycles will continue until we meaning me and you can educate, help them relate survive and break those battles that devoured the inside out and back in again pain to shame turn to insane to get used to the game what a shame for humanity to leave such beautiful babies on the street so free what a pity for these pretty babies to have no family

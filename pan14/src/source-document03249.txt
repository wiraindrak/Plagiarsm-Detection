Two-Year Strategic State Workforce Investment Plan
The State of Michigan's original plan development was a collaborative effort between the Governor appointed State Board: Council for Labor & Economic Growth (CLEG) and the Michigan Department of Labor & Economic Growth (DLEG).  The DLEG encompasses all of the state's job development, workforce development, and economic development into one centralized agency.  Input was also sought for the original plan and the modifications from individuals representing education, local workforce development systems, human services, business and industry, and other interested parties whose expertise correlated with plan components. The state's goals and initiatives, as developed by the Governor, shape all state policies and strategies presented in the State Plan.  Solicited plan information and all necessary modifications were collected by the DLEG staff and compiled into a working document specifically tailored to Michigan's workforce investment system. The final State Plan was approved by the CLEG at its March 5, 2007, meeting. The unique and diverse composition of the CLEG ensured that all facets of the State's workforce investment system had a voice in the final plan and that the plan itself represents a comprehensive strategy for attaining the Governor's goals and initiatives.
The State Plan was approved by the United States Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration on July 29, 2007.

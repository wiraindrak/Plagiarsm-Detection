Benefits of Touch-Typing
Touch-typing means typing with all your fingers and without need for looking at the keyboard for finding the keys. Once learned, the technique has enormous benefits, which are:
Increased Efficiency
Touch-typing is more efficient because the typist uses all fingers instead of just a few fingers. As a result, typing speed will increase dramatically. This means that the time taken by a touch-typist to type a given number of characters is considerably less than the time taken by a two-finger hunt-and-peck typist and thus dozens of valuable working hours can be saved each year.
Increased Effectiveness
Touch-typing is more effective because the typist looks at the output on the screen, not the keyboard. This is especially advantageous when one is creating a document (as opposed to copying one) such as a letter, an essay, a presentation or a book. Not having to look at the keyboard to find the keys, the typist can focus on the output with a resulting increase in quality.
Less Mental Fatigue
Touch-typing is less demanding on the brain because the brain does not need to cope with two issues, that of locating the keys and focusing on the output. The brain is then single-mindedly focused on the output.
Less Physical Fatigue
Touch-typing is also less tiring because it distributes the total load over all fingers. Touch typing, because of its natural and flowing finger movements, results in less stress.
Less Wear and TearTouch-typing reduces wear and tear on the few fingers that are constantly being used. The load is spread over many more fingers and thus the risk of Cumulative Trauma Disorder (also known as Occupational Overuse Syndrome) is reduced.

A new StreetView-like service for Central Europe
As reported by , has just launched a StreetView-like service for a handful of countries in Europe. They use the Google Maps API to power their product, then drop in a bunch of interactive panoramic images. You can’t move up up down streets quite as easily, but they provide small arrows in the corner to direct you to nearby paroramas, which are often just a few feet away (like StreetView).

All in all, I’m quite pleased with how these programs are working with Windows 7. I had intended to say “this works, that doesn’t, etc”, but everything works (for the most part). I am very impressed with Windows 7 speed-wise, too. It’s had a few hiccups (video card didn’t want to play nice), but these apps are FLYING on this old machine.
By the time it goes gold, I expect big things out of it.

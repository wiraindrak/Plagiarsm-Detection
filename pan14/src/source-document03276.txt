Overview
The Vehicle Personal Property Tax Division in the Commissioner of Revenue’s Office is responsible for the assessment of all vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, boats, aircraft and motor homes) that are located in Arlington County. The authority to levy this tax is in accordance with the Code of Virginia and local ordinances. Under the Code of Virginia, the Commissioner of Revenue has the duty of assessing personal property at fair market value in a fair and equitable method for taxing purposes. The tax is assessed based on the value of the motor vehicle. The Commissioner uses the lowest value in recognized pricing guides, such as the National Automobile Dealer's Association Used Car Guide, as the basis for vehicle assessments. Your 2008 Vehicle Personal Property tax amount will be based on the following formulas:
The 2008 tax rate is $5.00 per $100 of assessed value. Vehicles are assessed for the number of months they are located in Arlington County.
Qualifying vehicles shall receive 100% tax relief on the first $3,000 of value, and the balance of relief then being equally distributed for each dollar of value up to $20,000 in value. For any value of a qualifying vehicle in excess of $20,000, there shall be no tax relief. The relief to be equally “distributed” shall mean the funds provided by the Commonwealth specifically for such tax relief.
All other vehicles which do not meet the definition of “qualifying” will not be eligible for any form of tax relief under this program.

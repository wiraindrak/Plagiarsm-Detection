Recipes on PWS
Is it ok to post recipes on our PWS? I want to add the Southwest pork tenderloin recipe - is it against the PC law to post a PC recipe if they could get it in a cookbook currently for sale? I thought it might attract guests from my shows to my website if they have to go there for the recipe. Just making sure before I add recipes.

I post a monthly recipe on my PWS. I do make sure it is a PC recipe though. At shows I tell people if they give me their e-mail address I will send them a monthly recipe. When I send them out through my PWS I put in the message line YOUR MONTHLY PC RECIPE IS HERE. This way they get a chance to see my whole website. I do have the MONTHLY RECIPE on my homepage screen for them to click on.

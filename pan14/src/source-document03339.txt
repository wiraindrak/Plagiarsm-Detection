Midway opens an online arcade game site
,
When Midway left the arcade industry, it left a lot of people unhappy and in some cases devastated. They had bought up Atari Games not long before that and both companies had been powerhouses on the arcade scene in their own right for many years, both with games that went back to the golden age of gaming. So when they pulled the plug it wasn’t a good thing. To top that off I remember one of their execs thrashing arcades a couple of years ago in an interview and it was pretty obvious that they had no intention of getting back into the game. They still don’t but now they have an online game portal where you can go to play many different games from the Midway and Atari Games catalogues. I’m sure it’s just another way for them to cash in off these great classics, seeing how three different compilation disks have come to the last gen of consoles and several of these games can be downloaded to consoles and PCs already but at the very least Midway is recognizing their past here. It’s not enough to turn them around yet since they have been in a world of hurt lately but it’s always good to see arcade games getting a little recognition from companies that have long since dropped them by the wayside.

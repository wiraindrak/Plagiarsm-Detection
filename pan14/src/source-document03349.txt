We investigated the associations between plasmavery-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)apolipoprotein (apo)C-IIIand apoA-V concentrations and the kinetics of VLDLapoB-100and VLDL triglycerides in 15 men. We also explored the relationshipbetween these parameters of VLDL metabolism and VLDLapoC-IIIkinetics.Objective
ApoC-III, apoB, and triglyceridekinetics in VLDL were determined using stable isotopes and multicompartmentalmodeling to estimate production rate (PR) and fractional catabolicrate (FCR). Plasma VLDLapoC-III concentration was significantlyand inversely associated with the FCRs of VLDL triglycerides(=0.610) and VLDLapoB (=0.791), and positivelycorrelated with the PR of VLDLapoC-III (=0.842). However,apoA-V concentration was not significantly associated with anyof the kinetic variables. There was a significant association(<0.01) between the PRs of VLDL triglycerides and VLDLapoB(=0.641), and between the FCRs of VLDL triglycerides and VLDLapoB(=0.737). In multiple regression analysis, plasma VLDLapoC-IIIconcentration was a significant predictor of VLDL triglycerideFCR (ß-coefficient=0.575) and VLDLapoBFCR (ß-coefficient=0.839).Methods and ResultsrrrPrr
Our findings suggest that increased VLDLapoC-IIIconcentrations resulting from an overproduction of VLDLapoC-IIIare strongly associated with the delayed catabolism of triglyceridesand apoB in VLDL. We also demonstrated that the kinetics ofVLDL triglycerides and apoB are closely coupled. Our data donot support a role for plasma apoA-V in regulating VLDL kinetics.Conclusions
We investigated the associations between plasma VLDL-apoC-IIIand apoA-V concentrations and the kinetics of VLDL-apoB-100and VLDL triglyceride in 15 men. Increased VLDL-apoC-III concentrationsresulting from an overproduction of VLDL-apoC-III was a predictorof the delayed catabolism of VLDL triglyceride and VLDL-apoB.However, apo-V concentration was not significantly associatedwith VLDL kinetics.

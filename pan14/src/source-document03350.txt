A Grow Bed is the most efficient square yard of garden you'll ever tend. The recycled black plastic sides of this raised garden bed absorb heat to warm soil early in the season, then help retain moisture all summer long. No digging, no weeding required; just lots of delicious homegrown food! Our new 3' x 6' Grow Bed gives you twice as much growing space, and the new Mini Bed is perfect for narrow areas along a foundation or walkway. All sizes assemble quickly and have a generous 10" depth.

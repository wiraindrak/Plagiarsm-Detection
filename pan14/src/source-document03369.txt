Nokia, Reuters Try Mobile Journalism Experiment
Over the last few months, I have bumped into several people at conferences testing as a freebie the Nokia N95, which is a combination 5 pixel camera, cellphone, video camera, GPS and more all combined into a wallet-sized package.

This is a very easy-to-use application that takes account of the demands placed on journalists in the field,” said Nic Fulton, Chief Scientist of Reuters Media. “By running on handheld devices, rather than on bulkier laptop computers, the mobile journalism application enables us to create complete stories and file them for distribution, without leaving the scene. This saves us time and benefits our audience by ensuring that they receive high quality news that is absolutely up-to-date.”

I want to shoot better videos. However, whether I, and the other amateur videographers, want to go through the learning curve is another question that is yet to be answered.

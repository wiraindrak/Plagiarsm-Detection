Sandboxes
The kids wait impatiently as I release the tarp tabs and remove the green nylon cover from the sturdy hexagonal sandbox. The beach ball which had lifted the cover above the sand and created a dome effect, had by consequence also allowed the air trapped inside to warm up the surface of the sand. In an instant they were in kid heaven. There is nothing like clean and tidy sandboxes to keep children of all ages safely occupied for hours and hours, and no skill is required to assemble this wonderful creation with Frame it All's sandboxes and complete sandbox kits! I assembled it in less than an hour using the Frame It All joints and four feet long composite plastic timbers, which never rot, splinter and warp or lose their gorgeous natural wood grain finish. Low and behold it looked exactly like the photograph on the kit Box label. I decided to increase wall height by adding another level using stacking joints, which amazingly, slide into top of joints below and a second row of timbers. I didn't realize that building sandboxes could actually be this easy and could be considered a "do-it-yourself" undertaking. Of course adding the play sand was another matter. Luckily it was available at the garden center in easy to lift sacks.Frame It All: Revolutionizing Sandboxes

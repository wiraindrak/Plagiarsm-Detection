As newcomers flock to the area and explore their surroundings, long-time residents are meeting their neighbors - and discovering new opportunities - at every turn. Luxury developments line the riverbanks, and boutiques, restaurants and art galleries are opening
every week. Young
families fill the streets with baby carriages. Empty nesters and young artists wait together for trains running along the expanding light rail system. But change can be hard. Transformation

will do more. We'd
like our site to be a sort of meeting place a town square, if you will, where you can read about the people, politics and places that make living here so exciting. Passenger Rail NJ TRANSIT Trains Three NJ

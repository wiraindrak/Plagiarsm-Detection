She hiked the northern rim of the Grand Canyon with her father when she was nine years old. At the age of twelve she walked home in a thunderstorm over seven kilometres because she lost a tennis match. Two identical probes were launched in to study the more distant in the . Their primary missions completed, the two probes are currently drifting out of the known Solar System.

Recurring plots include the repercussions of the lengthy and brutal occupation of the nearby planet Bajor by the Cardassians, Sisko's unique spiritual role for the Bajorans as the Emissary of the Prophets, and a major war with the Dominion of the Gamma Quadrant.

what does the data tell us? These ten school districts are not starved for funding. All but two (Upper Darby and Erie City) have total expenditures above the State mean ($11,322). The weighted mean tells us that the mean black student is enrolled in a school with more expenditures than about 84% of PA school

Present Status As of February 2008, Voyager 1 was at a distance of 15.7 billion kilometers (105.3 Astronomical Units) from the Sun. Voyager 2 was at a distance of 12.7 billion kilometers (85 Astronomical Units) from the Sun.

according to Klingon legend, created by Kahless when dropping a strand of his hair in a vulcano and later into the lake Lursor. He then formed it into a bathleth which he used to kill Molor, a Klingon tyrant. A typical bat'leth is 116 centimeters long and is composed of baakonite metal. The Voyagers were designed to take advantage of a rare geometric arrangement of the outer planets that occurs only once every 176 years. This configuration allows a spacecraft to swing from one planet to the next without the need for large onboard propulsion systems; the flyby of each planet both accelerates the spacecraft and bends its flight path. A thermoelectric device is used to convert the heat to electric power which slowly decreases with time as the radioactive material is expended. While the initial (at launch) power output
of the generators was about 470 Watts of 30 V DC current, it had fallen off to about 335 W by 1997 (about 20 years after the launch). As of 2002, periodic contact is kept with both probes to monitor conditions in the outer reaches of the solar system, with the hope that the craft's power sources will hold up (with judicious power rationing) to locate the distance to the . radioactive heliopause

We have indications now, but we don't know accurately what's out there," he said. Other blanks Voyager may help fill in could be things like the nature of the interstellar magnetic field and the density of interstellar

Voyager was designed for planetary observations, so there it is unclear how much information can be gathered. More than 50,000 teachers and coaches have already experienced the award-winning program. All expressed high levels of satisfaction and more than 95 percent of teachers believe the courses enhanced their teaching effectiveness.       -Theresa Largenton, Massachusetts teacher"The course provided new information that will be helpful in my teaching. It also helped to validate what I am already doing." Because they orbit the Sun on either side of the Earth's orbital path, some of them are, from time to time, 180 away from Earth. They can sense parts of the Sun several days before the Sun's rotation reveals it to ground based/earth orbiting observatories.

Kelsie is very vocal and shes always calling out what shes seeing for the other defenders. Liberos take the majority of free ball and serve receive passes because passing is their area of expertise, said co-captain Alex Graves. If theres a ball in between
two players the libero is going to take it; she has precedence [in the back row]. As the teams second quarterbacknext to the setter, according to Coach Papineau, the position involves a lot of leadership and experience. With the addition of the position on high school teams, collegiate programs are beginning to see many more specialized liberos who have been playing the position
their entire career. Also, with athletes getting bigger every year, it allows a smaller, more agile player play in a game which, in the past, has been much like the best rides at an amusement parkyou have to first pass the height requirement in order to get in. Questions? Email the Pioneer - -

(pronounced lee-BEH-roe) is a type of player that has never before been seen in collegiate sports. This new position came into being in college volleyball in 2002 and was adopted by high school programs in 2006. A defensive specialist would be the best way to explain it, said sophomore
libero and co-captain Kelsie Butts. Five California beaches for the circuit are Santa Barbara, Will Rogers
State Beach, Sorrento Beach, Laguna Beach, and San Diego. Also in the 1950, the first volleyball
tournament
takes place in Brazil. The tournament is sponsored by a newspaper publishing.In the 1950 The first Manhattan Beach Open in beach volleyball history takes place in 1960.

different colored jersey to help the referees in this quick substitution. I think its made the womens game faster and more exciting. At the top levels of the game, its made it necessary to have smarter and more powerful attackers because the defense on the other side of the net is much more dynamic, said Carolyn Papineau, Whitmans
head volleyball coach. Beyond the
impact that the position has had on the game, the libero position created a niche in volleyball for smaller, more nimble players who might never have had the opportunity to play at the collegiate level before. Its definitely been a cool opportunity for
girls my height to play just because, you know, Im not some 6-foot hitter, said the 5-foot-5-inch Butts.

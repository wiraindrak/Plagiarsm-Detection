These relationships are critical to our
future success - they solidify our role as champions of quality and progress at every level of the coffee business. It is because of these relationships
that Starbucks gets the first pick of the

OF STORY Health-conscious New Yorkers will have to wait
a little longer for calorie information to show up on
restaurant menus. Some New York
City eateries were supposed
to begin publishing calorie counts today, but health officials have delayed the measure.
Marketplace's Amy Scott
reports.Doug Krizner: The New York City health department has postponed the calorie requirement until April 15. That gives a federal judge time to
decide whether the new rule is legal.Amy Scott:
Having a great logo, menu design and unique ambience or building design will tell your customers that story. Establishing a great second brand will also
make marketing and
business unique in a sea of common building
designs and menus. Juice Jungle uses a number of ploys in its branding, including the menu with named drinks to tell its story, like the Orangutango, Chocolate
Monkey, Berry Baloo, Tsunami Splash or a Jungle Fever loaded with supplements. Kool Beanz, Inc., is now franchising our Java Espress and Juice Jungle drive-thru shops that offer the great benefit of two brand destinations in one location. Learn More About the Coffee Experience The history of coffee is an incredibly interesting story that stretches back 1,000 years. But if you’re new to this , you’ll want to know more about how coffee is , how it is , how it is , and what to look for when . history grown roasted prepared tasting   Starbucks said the addition of the new menu items is the companys next step in its commitment to providing food and beverage selections that support a
healthy lifestyle. All of the items are made with wholesome ingredients such as whole grains, real fruit, nuts and seeds, and omega-3 fatty acids. The products also do not have artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners or high-fructose corn syrup. The fact is, it was quietly tested in a neighboring Seattle area B market, before Starbucks rolled out its new nutrition based smoothie program. Now imagine how you can keep the quality control, the speed and consistency of both espresso coffee and real fruit smoothies without sacrificing quality in either one. Such a company has created exactly that: Java Espress and Juice Jungle drive thrus. The parent company Kool Beanz, Inc., Idaho Falls,
Idaho, has designed a building and menu concept with two distinct brands under one roof.
The concept isn hard to imagine if
you picture that KFC, A&W and Taco Bell have begun to share
the same store with their dual
brand concepts. Juice Jungle came to life and has became a brand of its own today with proprietary
real fruit drink combinations and a line of Koffee Kickers, a frozen blended coffee smoothie
with non-fat yogurts. With such an immediate customer response, the current single brand Java Espress drive thrus became obsolete, and a
new design was eminent in order to sustain
profitability in the midst of this severe
and growing recession. After becoming one of the first companies to offer
stock
options to its part-time employees, Starbucks
becomes a publicly traded company.1990s The
Starbucks phenomenon continues.  Our first store in Australia opens in
July 2000 at Hyde Park in Sydney,
NSW.  2000s As of this writing,
Starbucks has more than 13,000 locations in over 41 countries. In
addition to our excellent coffees and espresso drinks, people now also
enjoy Tazo® tea and Frappuccino®
blended beverages. But the restaurant lobby's Chuck
Hunt says those chains are made up of small
franchise owners, who can't afford the expense. When the cost of this is
passed on by the franchisor, it's the small business that gets
affected.Chuck Hunt: New York University
nutrition professor Marion Nestle thinks
there's another reason the restaurant lobby objects.
Restaurant owners tell me that they absolutely believe
that if people knew how many calories
were in the food, they wouldn't eat it.Marion Nestle: Or at least not as
much of it. One major chain here is expected to comply with the original deadline. But in 1971, you would have had to travel all the way to our only store in
Seattle’s historic Pike
Place Market. The first Starbucks opens. The name comes from Herman
Melville’s Moby Dick, a classic American novel about the 19th century
whaling industry. The seafaring name seems
appropriate for a store that imports the world’s finest coffees to the cold,
thirsty people of Seattle.1970s Howard
Schultz joins Starbucks in 1982. While on a business trip in Italy, he visits Milan’s famous espresso bars. Impressed with their popularity and culture, he sees their potential in Seattle. He’s right – after trying lattes and mochas, Seattle quickly becomes coffee-crazy.1980s Four people can work comfortably and make drinks in rapid order. e

selection at CVI-owned Starbucks outlets differs slightly from standard
Starbucks outlets by
failing to include certain staples, such as
canned and bottled Starbucks beverages, and certain fare, notably
the , is only available during specific seasons. CVI outlets in Quebec
use for all drink sizes (piccolo, mezzo,
grande, venti), as opposed to -style
Starbucks which use a mix of
and Italian terms (short, tall, grande, venti). First and foremost is always space for equipment and preparation. To add real fresh fruit smoothies, a store you will need
adequate freezer space for yogurts and fruit, dipping wells,
juice machines, counter space and
blenders. For this reason, many shops take a
shortcut into smoothie production by using a variety of premixed
products that are available from various suppliers around the
country. Most of these simply are
a frozen sugar-filled puree, that when
blended with ice will create a textured frozen drink. Roasty-sweet blend of Fairtrade certified Latin American and East African beans help

Coffees Meet Starbucks
Standards The coffee we buy is truly special, spectacular coffee. The coffee buying team evaluates over 1,000 "offer samples" each year, and only a few make it into our warehouses. Starbucks coffee buyers spend approximately 18 weeks per year traveling to countries of origin. The purpose of these travels is not to directly buy coffee. Americans consumed $2 billion in smoothies in 2007, according to Mintel International Group; with one analyst predicting the demand for smoothies will increase in annual sales by two-thirds from 2005 to 2010. So what's behind this smooth
trend in America? It can easily be explained: convenience, taste and healthy
lifestyle choices. From
teenagers who love the taste to boomers who are looking
for a healthy beverage alternative, smoothies are the
answer. Having a unique brand enables Java Espress and Juice Jungle to create their own recognition and establish their own customer base. When a customer recognizes your brand they recognize more than just your business name, they recognize your building, your products, your marketing and your staff. A good brand will tell the story about who you are and what you offer by simply looking at your facility. McDonald, for example, has the olden archesto tell their story. In fact, it is
hard to even see the words McDonald spelled out on the arches; they can simply fly solo and have a recognized
brand. The large chains promote asty, nutritious
blends that are ideal for a healthy snack or as a meal
replacement.There is, in fact, a real
opportunity to make this
promise an honest product benefited by
creating vitamin-rich smoothies in a variety of real fruit
flavors, blends and nutritional additive value.
A coffee and smoothie shop located in a
convenient spot where one can quickly pick up a healthy snack or an alternative
to breakfast or lunch promises to have a better chance of making a profit in these tough economic times -
if it is done with originality. Until November 2006, CVI Starbucks locations did

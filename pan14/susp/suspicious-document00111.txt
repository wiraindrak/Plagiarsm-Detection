Such destruction (recycling) of crust takes place along convergent boundaries where plates are moving toward each other, and sometimes one plate sinks (is ) under another. The location where sinking of a plate occurs is called asubductedsubduction zone. The type of convergence -- called by some a very slow "collision" -- that takes place between plates depends on the kind of lithosphere involved. In transpressional orogens (e.g., the Mesoproterozoic Albany Mobile Belt of Western or the Tertiary Spitsbergen fold and
thrust belt, Svalbard, Norway), lateral
displacement between plates occurs in addition to folding and
thrusting. Transpressional orogens are
created by the oblique convergence between two continental plates and do not necessitate closure of an ocean. lithospheric plates crust island arcs lithosphere minerals subduction zone Australia Both upper and exhumed lower crustal rocks in collisional and transpressional orogens frequently display evidence for late orogenic extension, or cyclic changes between regional shortening and extension.

earthquakes "People often think of glaciers as inert and slow-moving, but in fact they can also move rather quickly," says G ran Ekstr m, professor of Geology and Geophysics. (Photo by Kris Snibbe/Harvard News Office) Global warming yields 'glacial earthquakes' in polar areas Seismologists at Harvard University and Columbia University have found an unexpected offshoot of global warming: "glacial earthquakes" in which Manhattan-sized glaciers lurch unexpectedly, yielding temblors up to magnitude 5.1 on the moment-magnitude scale, which is similar to the Richter scale. Shake the bottle of
rheoscopic fluid to
ensure it is thoroughly
mixed. Fill the French square
bottle
completely with rheoscopic fluid, being careful not to leave any pockets of air. Screw the cap on tightly. Place the bottle on the ring stand as shown in figure 1. Place the lamp directly under the center of the bottle as shown in figure 1. Do not turn on the lamp. Procedure Begin by asking the class to share what they know

One of the early warnings comes from nearby animals.
Many animals sense danger and flee to
higher ground
before the water
arrives. The Lisbon quake is the first documented case of such a phenomenon in Europe. The phenomenon was also noted in in the . Some scientists speculate that animals may have an ability to sense subsonic from an earthquake minutes or hours before a tsunami strikes shore (Kenneally, ).

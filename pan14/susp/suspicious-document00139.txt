Her presence destabilizes the social order of the caste system, and i>her father deathis a catalyst for the political revolt against the throne (emphasis added 4.5.77). Ophelia also endangers the Queen title of mother with the potential of Hamlet yet-unborn child(67). he Queen hostility towards Ophelia initially appears through sophisticated strategies of aggression, but the increasing dangers force stronger defenses. Whether resulting from
physical action or ethical stagnation, the Queen is culpable in the death of Ophelia(68). A reader puzzled by this might stop to consider that Laertesunequivocal preference for bloodthirsty revenge is contrasted to the complexity of Hamlet view. Psychoanalytic critics who remain in thrall to the idea that Hamlet unequivocally endorses bloodthirsty revenge see his backing off from the resolve to execute such a revenge in the Prayer Scene as rationalization. But I think Shakespeare meant Hamlet harsh resolve to be understood as a kind of self-disgust and thus as a kind of moral strength.  · full titleThe Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark    · London, England, early seventeenth century (probably –)time and place written16001602    · , in a pirated quarto edition

Hamlet’s grief and misery is such that he frequently longs for death to end his suffering, but he fears that if he commits suicide, he will be consigned to eternal suffering in hell because of the Christian religion’s prohibition of suicide. In his famous “To be or not to be” soliloquy (III.i), Hamlet philosophically concludes that no one would choose to endure the pain of life if he or she were not afraid of what will come after death, and that it is this fear which causes complex moral considerations to interfere with the capacity for action.

Critics such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge have been horrified by Hamlet’s words here—he completely oversteps the bounds of Christian morality in trying to damn his opponent’s soul as well as kill him. But apart from this ultraviolent posturing, Hamlet has once again avoided the imperative to act by involving himself in a problem of knowledge. Now that he’s satisfied that he knows Claudius’s guilt, he wants to know that his punishment will be sufficient. Posting Option #25: here for a hint In scene 3, Claudius plots with Rosencranz and Guildenstern to get Hamlet to England-- at a safe distance from any harm he might do in Denmark.  Claudius does not state to Rosencranz and Guildenstern that he plans to get Hamlet executed in England. Polonius resolves to spy on Hamlet when he confronts Gertrude. Shakespeare's is one of the most
familiar works of Renaissance
literature. The drama of this play concerns problems as revealed through an individual family. The problems of society at large are seen through the eyes, actions and thoughts of members of that family. A ruler is holding power, and a great deal of the action is related to questions about the nature of that power. Hamlet, or Amleth, was a legendary Danish prince (see: ) whose exploits were recorded by in his around 1200 AD; Francois de Belleforest adapted Saxo's story in his (1570). Shakespeare's main source, however, is believed to be an earlier play about Hamlet (the ), which is attributed to and is known to have introduced a ghost to the story. Shakespeare may also have taken some elements from Kyd's other play, , especially the hero's procrastination.   Hamlet himself is unsure whether his father’s apparition is truly the king’s spirit or an evil demon, but he declares that he cares nothing for his life and that, if
his soul is immortal, the ghost can do nothing to harm his soul. He follows after the apparition and disappears into the darkness. "Today we tend to associate the soliloquy primarily with mediation and the expression of emotion, with introspection, and with what Matthew Arnold called the dialogue of the mind with itself Yet,
in pre-Shakespearean drama it was only occasionally used for purposes which had to do with reflection or inner conflict: more often if fulfilled the function of the chorus...of clarification of the plot To what extent does the soliloquy now also give expression to a false or distorted self-image, to an element of self-deception, or even a deliberate attempt to deceive others? About thirty years old at the start of the play, Hamlet is the son of Queen Gertrude and the late King Hamlet, and the nephew of the present king, Claudius. Hamlet is melancholy, bitter, and cynical, full of hatred for his uncle’s scheming and disgust for his mother’s sexuality. A reflective and thoughtful young man who has studied at the University of Wittenberg, Hamlet is often indecisive and hesitant, but at other times prone to rash and impulsive acts.Hamlet Turning to Prince Hamlet, Claudius asks why “the clouds still hang” upon him, as Hamlet is still wearing black mourning clothes (I.ii.). Gertrude urges him to cast off his
“nightly colour,” but he replies bitterly that his inner sorrow is so great
that his dour appearance is merely a poor mirror of it (I.ii.). Affecting a tone of fatherly advice, Claudius declares that all fathers die, and all sons must lose their fathers. It is also important to note that Hamlet is extremely melancholy and discontented with the state of affairs in Denmark and in his own family—indeed, in the world at large. He is extremely disappointed with his mother for marrying his uncle so quickly, and he repudiates , a woman he once claimed to love, in the harshest terms. His words often indicate his disgust with and distrust of women in general.      -  The Lord Chamberlain of Claudius’s court, a pompous, conniving old man.

The commedia dell'arte plays are now rarely performed, but the theatrical traditions of the commedia can be seen in Mozart's or in a Marx brothers skit or in the improvisational moviemaking of Robert Altman or Mike Leigh. Its artistry took the form not of the single controlling genius but of virtuoso collaboration.Figaro >4 Cyberdrama presents us with the possibility for both kinds of virtuoso authorship and for many mixtures of the two. Pressed by to
reveal the location of Polonius’s body, Hamlet is by turns inane, coy, and clever, saying that Polonius is being eaten by worms, and that the king could send a messenger to find Polonius in heaven or seek him in hell himself. Finally, Hamlet reveals that Polonius’s body is under the stairs near the castle lobby, and the king dispatches his attendants to look there. It is no surprise, then, that many of Shakespeare’s plays from this period, including Hamlet, concern transfers of power from one monarch to the next. These plays focus particularly on the uncertainties, betrayals, and upheavals that accompany such shifts in power, and the general sense of anxiety and fear that surround them. The situation Shakespeare presents at the beginning of Hamlet is that a strong and beloved king has died, and the throne has been inherited not by his son, as we might expect, but by his brother. There is, however, also a huge negative side.  It's entirely possible – nay, likely – that if I watch the episode I'll be massively

Anguished to have lost his sister so soon after his father’s death, Laertes flees the room. Claudius summons Gertrude to follow. He tells her it was nearly impossible to quiet Laertes’ rage, and worries that the news of Ophelia’s death will reawaken it. But where Hamlet has sunk into despair, contemplation, and
indecision, Fortinbras has devoted himself to the pursuit of revenge.
This contrast will be explored much more thoroughly later in the play. Here, it is important mainly to note that Fortinbras’s uncle has forbidden him to attack Denmark but given him permission to ride through Denmark on his way to attack Poland. Whereas the play up to this point has been divided into a number of separate settings, this scene begins to blend together elements of different settings. Hamlet, for instance, has been associated with the world inside Elsinore, but he now makes his appearance in the darkness outside it. Likewise, the terror outside the castle so far has been quite separate from the revelry inside, but now the sound of Claudius’s carousing leaks through the walls and reaches Hamlet and his companions in the night. Rather than directly teaching the junior physicians and giving them a chance to improve, as real nurses generally would, the nurse characters simply reported the problems to the senior physicians, who then came down hard. (Ironically, an of the sitcom "Scrubs" this season actually outdid "ER" on this point, showing nurse Carla Espinosa teaching clueless interns directly and even protecting them from unjustified senior physician wrath.) Gertrude actions undermine the very foundations of his ethical framework on how society functions. Hamlet thoroughly despises his uncle, not only because of his attempt to substitute old Hamlet but because of his betrayal of his
brother. Claudiusattempt to placate and ingratiate himself with his stepson is spurned by Hamlet who responds, little more than kin, and less than kindtoo his referral as onby his uncle. 'They did it to Themselves' They Did it to Themselves The fall of Romeo and Juliet is a culmination of many factors.

Whatever the case, it is Gertrude’s speech to Claudius that cements the king’s secret plan to have Hamlet executed in England. Claudius Gertrude Hamlet Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Polonius Ophelia   Hamlet enters, speaking thoughtfully and agonizingly to himself about the question of whether to commit suicide to end the pain of experience: “To be, or not to be: that is the question” (III.i.). He says that the miseries of life are such that no one would willingly bear them, except that they are afraid of “something after death” (III.i.). This article approaches as “an exploration of the crisis of selfhood that results when Aquinas’ carefully observed laws collide, collapsing the hierarchical structure of being that defines the individual into a jumble of conflicting perspectives” (123). In the play, “any event in its actuality tends to get lost, and gives rise instead to a story or interpretation on the
part of a witnessing agent,
which
then achieves a certain life of its own” (124). Is
it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wanned, Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit; and all for nothing!

begin to enact the play in full, and we learn that the man who kills the king is the king’s nephew. Throughout, Hamlet keeps up a running commentary on the characters and their actions, and continues to tease Ophelia with oblique sexual references. Do you think this is true, or is Hamlet merely play-acting insanity? What evidence can you cite for either claim? Study Questions   1. Shakespeare includes characters in who are obvious foils for Hamlet, including, most obviously, Horatio, Fortinbras, Claudius, and Laertes. Compare and contrast Hamlet with each of these characters. How are they alike? How are they different? How does each respond to the crises with which he is faced?Hamlet For instance, whether Hamlet’s mother, Gertrude, shares in Claudius’s guilt; whether Hamlet continues to love Ophelia even as he spurns her,
in
Act III; whether Ophelia’s death is
suicide or accident; whether the ghost offers reliable knowledge, or seeks to deceive and tempt Hamlet; and, perhaps most importantly, whether Hamlet would be morally justified in taking revenge on his uncle. Hamlet’s confrontation with death, manifested primarily in his discovery of Yorick’s skull, is, like Ophelia’s drowning, an enduring image from the play. However, his solemn theorizing explodes in grief and rage when he sees Ophelia’s funeral procession, and his assault on Laertes offers a glimpse of what his true feelings for Ophelia might once have been. The production strips the play to its most basic, even primal, aspect: A fundamentally decent young man must -- on the word of a ghost -- commit a coldblooded murder because it is his duty as a son. All of his attendant anxieties, confusions and fears (Freudian and
otherwise) are played out with a chilling, childlike
simplicity. The supporting ensemble is uniformly wonderful, from Kavsadze's corrupt, glowering Claudius to Greg Marzullo's impetuous, impassioned Laertes to Jonathan Leveck's stolid, dissembling Polonius. It is his faith which saves him from despair, because he understands the value of suffering, and because he looks forward in faith, hope and charity and joy, to an eternity in Heaven! Therea (line 18). And it is this key inclusion which redirects the whole soliloquy, making Hamlet an apologist for the Four Last Things; for the personal judgment before a personal God; for the places known as Heaven and Hell where souls are destined for all eternity. Hamlet’s death at the hands of Laertes makes his earlier declaration over Polonius’s corpse, that God has chosen “to punish me with this and this with me,” prophetic
(III.iv.). His murder of
Polonius does punish him in the end, since it is Laertes’ vengeful rage over that murder that leads to Hamlet’s death. Ophelia 174   That death is neither heroic nor shameful, according to the moral logic of the play. Professor Ann Thompson, King's College London The three texts A short play called The was printed in 1603. It was ascribed to William Shakespeare on its title-page - which also claimed that it had been ‘diverse times acted by his Highnesse seruants in the Cittie of London: as also in the two Vniuersities of Cambridge and Oxford, and elsewhere’. This text is known as the First Quarto (Q1). Act IV, scene iv restores the focus of the play to the theme of human action. Hamlet’s encounter with the Norwegian captain serves to remind the reader of Fortinbras’s presence in the world of the play and gives Hamlet another example of the will to action that he lacks. Earlier, he was amazed by the player’s evocation of powerful feeling for Hecuba, a legendary character who meant nothing to him (II.ii). It
was key to Jacobi's portrayal that
this great sequence of scenes should begin with the 'To be or not to be' soliloquy and the nunnery scene with Ophelia.  That for him was the moment when Hamlet comes closest to breaking, the moment when, through Ophelia's lies and evasions, he realizes the full extent of his own isolation.  In the Prospect Theatre production, he attempted to heighten that effect by an innovation that will not be seen in the BBC production.  The 'To be or not to be' speech was spoken not as a soliloquy at all but directed to Ophelia, with the 'Soft you now / the fair Ophelia' being spoken as a response to her attempt at interjection.  Jacobi argued his case for this innovation persuasively and felt that apart from textual arguments, it made dramatic sense--Ophelia's treachery being the more acute coming after learning of Hamlet's thoughts of
suicide.  But his urgings
failed to convince his BBC director, Rodney Bennett.  On television, the speech will be spoken directly to the camera; the only concession to Jacobi's views being the fact that Ophelia is seen to enter halfway through it and could, therefore, possibly be assumed to overhear it.  Jacobi was upset at the decision, but bowed to it.  "The BBC's brief for the Shakespeare productions is not to be controversial but to respect tradition," he said, "and they fought shy of the idea of presenting the most famous soliloquy ever written as part of a dialogue.  I think they felt that if we did that, it would be the only aspect of the production anyone would discuss afterwards, and I could see their point.  But I still think I'm right, and I think it helps to make sense of what follows.  But even without that device, I think--I hope--that that great sequence of scenes works, that we keep up the unbearable pitch, the relentless pressure,....because I'm convinced that if we do, no audience will pause to ask questions like 'Is Hamlet mad?', 'Why doesn't he kill Claudius after the play scene?'.  They will be on the same plane of exaltation as the actors;  they will be carried, like Hamlet, on the tide of those events." In this
scene, as he carefully instructs Reynaldo in the art of snooping, he seems more the manipulator than the fool, though his obvious love of hearing his own voice leads him into some comical misphrasings (“And then, sir, does a this — a does — / what was I about to say? By the mass, I was about to say some / thing. Where did I leave?” [II.i.–]).4951 This article declares that the “To be, or not to be” passage was originally staged as “a feigned soliloquy, spoken by Hamlet to mislead other characters about his state of mind” (2). The Shakespearean canon provides evidence that Shakespeare, perhaps more than other playwrights, “explored the potential consequences, comic and tragic, of the fact that human beings do not have access to one another’s minds” (9). This following quotation suggests one of the reasons for this situation, which is unique when dealing with a masterpiece of its stature: " Most likely , then, Shakespeare's Hamlet is a
revision of a dramatic treatment ( Ur-Hamlet ) of a retelling ( Belleforest
) of a literary treatment (Saxo ) of a Scandinavian legend."

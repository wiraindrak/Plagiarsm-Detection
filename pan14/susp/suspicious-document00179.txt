Land Rover History When I lived in the UK, my "car" was a little unusual, in that it was an ex-MoD Series 3 109" Land Rover. The British Army took delivery in January 1973, making it a little older than myself. In September 2006, Land
Rover released information on a series of long-anticipated changes to the Defender, most of which were implemented to meet upcoming emissions and safety legislation. The biggest change was to the drivetrain. The Td5 engine will be dropped, being replaced by an engine from Ford's DuraTorq line, built in their factory in Dagenham. The engine chosen was from the ZSD family, being a version of the 2.4-litre four-cylinder unit also used in the highly successful Ford Transit and the famous London taxi built by Manganese

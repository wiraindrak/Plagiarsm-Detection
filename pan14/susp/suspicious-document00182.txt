Scipione del Ferro (1465-1526), of the
University of Bologna, solved the "depressed cubic," ax^3+cx+d=0. He kept his solution an absolute secret. This may seem surprising today, when mathematicians are usually very eager to publish their results, but in the days of the Italian Renaissance secrecy was customary. Academic appointments were not easy to secure and dependent on the ability to prevail in public contests. Such challenges could be issued at any time.

In 1931 he was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Leipzig where he became a colleague of . In his ballistic studies he proposed new ideas, methods, and instruments, important among which are "firing tables". He had various proposals on fortifications. He suggested two instruments for determining inaccessible heights and distances, the first telemeters. He developed a specific form the the compass, or better, the housing in which it was set, that made it more useful in surveying. 10.

Some scholars think that they were closed by the patriarch on order of the Christian Roman emperor in 391 AD. The following essays discuss in more detail some
of the aspects and the divine nature of the
Gods. This is not a complete list, but covers
some of the more well known, and some not so widely known Gods from civilisations around the world. Thoth - Lord of the Holy Words The most popular and enduring of all the gods, Thoth has been responsible for keeping Egyptian magic in the forefront of learning since the collapse of the empire.Thoth - Lord of the Holy Words The more modern interpretation: geometry treats of objects, which are denoted by the words straight line, point, etc. No knowledge or intuition of these objects is assumed i.e., axioms are free creations of the human mind. All otherbut only the validity of the axioms, such as the one statedabove, which are to be taken in a purely formal sense,as void of all content of intuition or experience. Thesepropositions of geometry are logical inferences from theaxioms (which are to be taken in the nominalistic senseonly). Euclid then shows the of geometric and of , based on those axioms. He proves new higher ideas are
true from these lower ideas. This is the same method as modern uses. It is called the .the father of geometry mathematics Elements textbook set axioms properties objects whole numbers mathematics axiomatic method ancient Egypt Rope stretchers surveyors measured property foundations knotted cords

The plummet can be used with a square ruled off into intervals on tongue and blade to get a unit rise and run or angle when taking an elevation to a distant point as with a modern sextant. André Weil 1998   Charles Ehresmann Benoît Mandelbrot fractal (1906-1998) and (1904-1994) were present at preliminary meetings before the actual foundation of the Bourbaki group.

There are other assumptions in the postulates which are not explicit. For example it is assumed that there is a unique line joining any two points. Similarly postulates two and three, on producing straight lines and drawing circles, respectively, assume the uniqueness of
the objects the possibility of whose construction is being postulated.Elements From these and other indications it seems probable that the extant writing is only an of the original work, made by an anonymous writer of much later date. epitome Byzantine The didactic aim of Stobaeus's work is apparent throughout.

More specifically, the notes, "On the Nile, moreover, he did so much that his sole efforts added greatly to the tithes of grain. He constructed bridges and temples porticos and basilicas, all by the labour of the soldiers, he opened up many river-mouths, and drained many marshes, and put in their place grain-fields and farms"(9.3-4).

The circumstance that there were so many towns called Hybla in Sicily probably arose from the fact mentioned by , that there was a local divinity of the name. (Paus. v. 23. 6.) ^ Pausanias For example, , Britain's foremost
classicist of the 19th century, begins to describe with an admixture of locational and historic information from both and Megara Hyblaea. Caution should therefore be used when assuming reference to "Hybla" in an ancient source refers to this city. This was a challenging but constructive argument at the time, and remains one that still has relevance today. Most conspicuously, Hjelmslev's lines of inquiry have been taken up by and (see the "Postulates of Linguistics" and "Geology of Morals" chapters of ), and subsequently their followers. culture society memory knowledge Gilles Deleuze Felix Guattari A Thousand Plateaus [] edit Terminology Hjelmslev introduced the terms , , and as linguistic units, analogous to , etc.glossemecenemeprosodemepleremephonememorpheme [1] From a careful study of the position of the Great Pyramid, it is to be found that under the modern earth ellipsoid model, the small circle circumference of
the earth at the latitude of the structure (parallel to the equatorial circumference), divided by the arc length up from the equator to the centre of the pyramid, is almost exactly ten times the ratio of the proposed earth year increase, being about 10.14567. The Queen's Chamber is the middle and the smallest, measuring approximately 5.74 by 5.23 meters, and 4.57 meters in height. The chamber is lined with fine limestone blocks and the pented roof is made of large limestone slabs. Its eastern wall has a large angular doorway or niche. Egyptologist believes that the Queen's chamber was intended as a , a structure found in several other Egyptian pyramids, and that the niche would have contained a statue of the interred. In a wider context, there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on . Here the emergence of , and similar antinomies of raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent. Cantor's set theory Russell's paradox naive set theory The formalist project suffered a
decisive
setback,
when in 1931 G del showed that it is
possible,
for any sufficiently large set of axioms (, for example) to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms. For Archimedes, who came immediately after the first, makes mention of Euclid; and further they say that Ptolemy once asked him if there was in geometry any shorter way that that of the and he replied that there was no royal road to geometry. He is then younger than the pupils of Plato, but older than Eratosthenes and Archimedes, the latter having been contemporaries, as Eratosthenes somewhere says. This substance can be sound, as is the case for most known languages, but it can be any material support whatsoever, for instance, hand movements, as is the case for . sign languages Hjelmslev also referred to as a non-linguistic element in his calculus of language, i.e. a level of independent of linguistic form.purport connotation In short, Hjelmslev was proposing an open-ended, scientific method of analysis as a new . In proposing this, he was reacting against the conventional view in that sounds should be the focus of enquiry. In mathematical astronomy his fame is due to the introduction of the astronomical , and his early contributions to understanding the movement of the . globe planets His work on shows

When it was revived by and others in the 16th century, it became the basis for quantitative work in science for a century, until it was replaced by the algebraic methods of . If two discs on Kare touching, their shadows on E also touch. Theshadow-geometry on the plane agrees with the disc-geometry on the sphere. If we call the disc-shadows rigid figures, then spherical geometry holds good on the planeEwith respect tothese rigid figures. In particular, the plane is finite withrespect to the disc-shadows, since only a finite number of theshadows can find room on the plane. disc-shadows are not rigid figures. Knowledge was given by the gods to solve the real-world problems of the engineers, tax collectors, and military officers. The gods even influenced their sophisticated skills in surveying and agriculture. Since the constellation of Orion was linked with (god of the dead), the orientation of temples and pyramids
required precise measurements. Aristotle's pupil, Eudemus, presents him as the contemporary of Plato (born 428/7) and Leodamas (born ca. 430), on the one hand, and of Theaetetus (born ca. 415), on the other (A6). Since it would be difficult to call him the contemporary of Theaetetus, if he were born much earlier than 435, this
is the earliest he was likely to have been born.   The photo on the Iliad index page is the arch of the Lion Gate at Mycenae; many of the key figures of the Iliad (if they actually existed) must have walked under this arch.   The photo on the Odyssey index page is a view of the Aegean which I took from the cruise ship taking us to Crete. A contemporary of Gauss, Fernidand Eisenstein (1823-1852) conjectured the following subset of the Fermat numbers consists only of primes: but this has not been verified. The first three are the Fermat primes, 5, 17, 65,537. The next number has more than 45,000 digits. -- Book V -- 25 theoremsThe Elements Book V treats ratio and

One strength of the book is that principles of map design are often best shown by visual example, and
another is that the examples are not tied to any one GIS software package.

Ideally he needs at least three images of the target landscape, usually taken by an orbiting spacecraft or a probe on a flyby to another destination. Only in rare cases can telescope images provide enough detail. The sun angle must be different for each exposure so each image shows different shadows.
By comparing
the shadows, the software
calculates slopes, which yield the altitudes of target features. If you animated the track over time, what would it tell you about the daily flow of traffic in a city? Imagine using Google Earth to show the data and compare it to the underlying imagery and data GE

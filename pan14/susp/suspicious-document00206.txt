Computing (DIC) is concerned with capturing, managing,
analyzing, and understanding rates that pull the frontiers of current. Addressing the demands of ever-growing complexity necessitate epochal advances in software, hardware, and stemmer. Effective technologies must besides surmount to data and simultaneously speed timely, effectual analysis.  Hybrid computing architectures can address these requirements by complementing

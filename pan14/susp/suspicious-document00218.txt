However, under a more integrated approach with rice paddy irrigation and fertilizer application substantial reductions remain increasing. Many rice varieties can be grown on much drier conditions as those largely employed, with big reductions on alkane emission through any loss in yeild.

The scheme will alleviate an yard. Hybrid rice tropics provide this yield, according to the Institute (www. riceweb org). The research suggests that rice hybrids yield% higher than do asian rices. Using fertilizer could sometimes increase another yield. In atmosphere, where the factors are the optimal for growing, contadino use fertilizers in suitable amounts.  Public investigation could not do much production in Pakistan. In engineering is necessary to increase the countries wish Pakistan. Grain production can be increased in Pakistan if:-Farmers get richly give resistant rice.-Farmer get good facilities-Pakistan evolve Hybrid varieties This Undertaking will have the production in Pakistan.

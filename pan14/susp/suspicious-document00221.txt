  Our Programs We have a special
program that allows foster children to take riding lessons at our rescue for no cost. These are some of our foster children in the program. Our volunteers Leslie & Gina assist these children with lessons under Genea's supervision. Both Leslie & Gina are very good with the children and devote several hours to our rescue.  All children learn to ride bareback before they learn western riding. So after going on an alpha hay only diet with more frequent farrier visits, our mare has been doing well ever since. Today I decided it was time to

Hannah's fall has been full of firsts. She attended her first dressage clinic with J. Ashton Moore in October, 2006. She wowed everyone with her solid work ethic, sweet disposition, calm and even temperament and most of all, how fast she caught on and
how hard she tried everything we asked
her to do. Find out which farriers are continuing their education by attending clinics and workshops put on by local
farrier groups. Take a critical look at horses shod by farriers you are considering. Does the farrier drive a dependable rig that is not likely to break down on the way to your appointment? Is he a successful, educated
professional respected in the community? Also autopsies on horses have shown that older horses have been sound and competing, while having abnormalities of the Navicular bone (Fran Jurga, August 1997, The Horse). This could mean that it may be useful to monitor for changes to the bone over time as they may indicate development of problems, which of course comes at a cost as X-rays and Vets do not come cheap. Prevention is, of course, wise. Abscesses or bruises can be limited by keeping the horse's environment free from debris, including nails and sharp stones. Shoes and pads will protect hooves from a rough, hard terrain. Monitor your horse's feet. Picking them before and after rides should be basic. No hoof, no horse - and that's no fun.Don't Let Hoof Injuries Keep You Off Your Horse First, examine the hoof wall for cracks. A brittle wall is a potential problem because it lets in dirt, bacteria, and fungus which can lead to abscesses, seedy toe, gravels and white-line
disease. All of these conditions result in a lame horse, something we would like to avoid! A brittle, cracked wall is primarily a genetic
problem. A bad-footed mare produces a bad-footed colt. Theme ShowsWant to do a different kind of show?

HORSESHOEING EVALUATION by Dr Catherine Dunnett Nutritionist With the promise of warmer weather on the way our paddocks should start to look greener with the flush of spring grass. However, for horses or ponies that have a tendency to be overweight, or are prone to laminitis, the advent of lush grazing is a headache. Laminitis is not
caused by excess protein in the
diet Your horse can be subjected to problems from excessive dampness in the stall, mold in his food or simply the ravages of old age. Your horse depends on you for basic health care. If you're a beginner, make
sure you have a reliable vet who's willing to take your calls and explain how to take care of the simple injuries. There's something in this barefoot method, something worth exploring further to guarantee your horses health, performance and longevity. It's recommended that the first place to start is the Natural Hoof "articles" section, and Dr Strasser's book "A Lifetime Of Soundness", which takes you through the whole barefoot philosophy. The next step is then to find an to give an assessment of your horse.Most horse owners The inside-sole "nubs" are gone, allowing a more natural contact of the hoof’s sole to the surface of the boot. The front buckle rivets are now recessed and will not touch the hoof wall. Easyboot sizing has been fine-tuned. Be sure to measure the hoof and verify sizing from the new chart, before purchasing a 2005 Easyboot.

fermentable carbohydrates account for more than 97% of the soluble carbohydrates in concentrates, whereas forages contain only 33%. Carbohydrates are not normally present in the hindgut in large quantities. The presence of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates results in an unusual growth of bacteria. The bacteria release a toxin which causes an over activation of enzymes in the laminae. Olivo's gypsy style of traveling has enabled her to carry information first
hand to thousands of people -
farriers, natural hoof care providers, veterinarians, chiropractors, massage therapists and especially to everyday horse owners. Ms. Olivo's informative lectures cover hoof care from ancient times to the present day. She
explains how, over the ages, humans developed horse husbandry methods of confinement and shoeing that became tradition, dispite its disregard for the basic needs of the horse - a herbiverous
herd-dwelling prey animal. They had me administer bute for a few days for the pain. But more importantly, they provided instructions to our farrier on how to trim our mare's hooves so the tips were much shorter and more rounded. Much like the natural condition of horses in the wild. In about four weeks she was back to her normal self again.

Whatever is done to the hoof, the next time it is picked up, whether  in 1 day or 1 month, it will have changed. One of the reasons barefoot trimmers have had so much success is
because they view hoof care holistically. So many issues impact the hoof: diet, environment, saddling,
riding, training and so
on. If something goes wrong you must dig deep to find out what it was. There is far less danger when no iron or nails are involved. Human back problems are
less
of an issue, too. This safer, more relaxed and informed way of administering hoof care is
revolutionizing the hoof care industry. Who is Martha Olivo? Martha Olivo was a farrier for 25 years before she became aware of the natural power of the hoof and its profound influence on the Whole Horse(tm).
Canker is now rarely seen but is a serious infection of the horn of the foot, which results in the formation of a soft, moist,
disintegrating growth of horn. It most commonly affects the hind feet and is most often seen in horses kept in wet tropical climates, or in large draught type horses. It is predisposed by long heel conformation which results in deep sweaty sulci adjacent to the frog. The information contained in this book on horse hoof diseases is as valuable and relevant today, as it was nearly 100 years ago. You can find just about everything you
wanted to know about hoof diseases and injury here.diseases of the horse's foot DISEASES OF THE HORSE'S FOOT By H. CAULTON REEKS Fellow of the
Royal College
of Veterinary Surgeons Author of 'The Common Colics of the Horse' The coffin joint may swell and become sore as a result of the problem with the navicular bone. Analgesic or other drugs for pain
may be given, but caution should be
used. Some of these drugs may cause ulcers and renal disease. As a last resort, the nerve supplying the back of the heel may need to be surgically cut. But, after a couple of weeks, your heels, sole and bottoms of your toes would be very tough, all except the instep where there is no ground contact. This is callusing and because of this you'd soon be walking without pain. It's exactly
the same with horses hooves. The way to be barefoot and natural is not just about de-shoeing your horse though. . Near the heel the
wall of the hoof turns back toward the front portion and this continuation forms a ridge on both sides of the frog known as the .The barsbars .
This surrounding structure encompasses the foot and all inner parts. It is elastic in nature and continually grows downward from the coronet.

want to know true, sound principles for keeping our horses lives healthy, long and enjoyable.  John saw the need for relevant information addressing specific issues that he or a fellow horse owner had.  Being a farrier and educator, John has developed a way of cutting to the root of the problem and addressing the question specificly without confusing the issue.   The middle layer composes the bulk of the hoof wall and is the most
dense portion. The inner layer is the laminar layer that forms the epidermal laminae of the hoof. This layer is concave from side to side and bears about 600 primary laminae, each of which bears 100 or more secondary laminae on its surface. These laminae firmly attach the coffin bone to the hoof wall. The upper, almost circular limit of the hoof capsule is the coronet (coronary band), having an angle to the ground of roughly similar magnitude in each pair of feet (i.e. fronts and backs). These angles may differ slightly from one horse to the other but not markedly. The walls originate from the coronet band. Since leaving the show, Chen has continued to be a successful chef. He currently runs the restaurant chain Shisen Hanten in Japan, which is a huge commercial success, with

Calendar of events, new products, news items from around the world, new research! As shown in figure 7, dropping a perpendicular line down from the coffin-joint's center of articulation (COA), we computed the distance from this point to the toe as a percent of the length from toe to heel at the ground level. In the case of figure 7, we find that 68.9% of the support lies ahead of the center of articulation. Figure 7 The "Toe/Support %" measures the percentage of the foot's support that is "ahead of" the coffin-joints center of articulation (COA). The hoof and its structures work together to absorb concussion, provide support, traction and rebound to help the horse move. A horses hoof functions best when it is unshod on a grass turf surface, says Dr. Scoggins. So why
use shoes? Shoes protect the hoof from man-made environments and help enhance some of the horse's physical activity. Also, some horses have such
severely flat or misshapen hooves that shoeing is necessary to maintain a useful horse. Well, that all
depends on who is doing the asking. Certainly a person who owns a horse would know about the horse. Any person wanting to ride a horse needs to know a number of parts of the horse. When you learn to ride a bicycle, some one tells you to hold onto the handle bars, sit in the seat and put your feet on the peddles. Laminitis is often a component or symptom of another disease or condition which must be treated concurrently or simultaneously. Each case must be considered individually, and we recommend that you consult with your veterinarian/farrier team regarding the health and care of your horse. called Laminitis & Founder: Prevention and Treatment for the Greatest Chance of Success, co-authored by Dr. Doug Butler and Dr. Combine the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients.

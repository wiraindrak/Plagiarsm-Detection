Material and Method We prospectively studied 374 consecutive patients who underwent open-heart surgery in our institution: coronary artery bypass (CABG) (n=128), Mitral valve replacement(MVR)(n=18), aortic valve replacement(AVR) (n=21), MVR and AVR(n=56), repair of ventricular septal defect (VSD) (n=51), repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) (n=57),CABG and valvular surgery (n=6), others (n=37). Results Among 374 patients
included in our study (mean age 34.46±25.68; 146 males), 192 developed new conduction disorders: symptomatic sinus bradycardia in 8%, atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response (AF) in 4.5%, first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB)in 6.4%, second-degree AVB in 0.3%, third-degree AVB in 7%, new right bundle
branch block (RBBB) in 33%, and new left
bundle branch block (LBBB) in 2.1%. In addition, Stress and Caffeine appears to cause problems in
some people. Arrhythmia can be mild and brief or it can be life threatening. Arrhythmia can be dangerous if it seriously disrupts the natural rhythm of the heart and is not corrected. Arrhythmia can result in death. There are several types of Arrhythmia as follows Tachycardia is named after the area from which it originates.
Diagnosis of hyponatremia with SIADH was done. Patient was started on fluid restriction; external rewarming was provided. Cosyntropin stimulation
test
was normal. During hospital stay
patients condition was
deteriorating. Twelve hours after presentation patient became comatose requiring endotracheal intubation. An MRI obtained five days prior revealed extensive white matter abnormality throughout cerebral hemispheres consistent with severe demyelinating disease. Palliative care consultation was obtained, after an extensive discussion with patients family a decision was made to extubate the patient and comfort care measures
were initiated. Usually,
ectopic rhythms originating around the AV Node will pace from ca. 40-60 bpm.ECG comments: :

necessary. The serum K+ level is not always an indication of the severity of the patient's situation. Some patients experience serious weakness and cardiac instability with only mild hypokalemia. Respiratory function may deteriorate rapidly and without warning.The patient must not be left unattended. The exact mechanism behind the acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is not known. The probable explanation is imbalance in
the regulation of colonic motor activity by the
autonomic nervous system. [1] [] edit Signs and symptoms [] edit Treatment It usually resolves with conservative therapy stopping oral

contains many small wires
with tiny electrodes at their tips. The
electrodes stimulate the heart to determine whether a serious arrhythmia can be triggered. Doctors can stimulate specific parts of the heart and thus determine which part is causing the arrhythmia. Adverse nervous system effects that have been reported in patients receiving spironolactone therapy include headache, drowsiness, lethargy, ataxia, weakness, and mental confusion. Muscular weakness may be a sign of
drug-induced hyperkalemia. Other adverse effects reported with spironolactone therapy include azotemia, renal dysfunction, renal failure (unspecified), fever, urticaria, maculopapular rash, erythema, azotemia, and, rarely, agranulocytosis. Due to the diuretic action of spironolactone, polyuria can be
troublesome for some patients during therapy. Patients in Group A had significantly shorter correctedQT interval
(QTc) at the time of conversion than
those in GroupB (433 vs. 501 ms, = 0.003). Two patients in Group A developedsevere bradycardia,
whereas three patients in Group B developedsevere ventricular tachycardia (VT).nnPPPP Conclusion: Compared with IB monotherapy, the combination therapy of esmololand IB appears to be more effective in conversion of
rapidlyconducting AF back to SR. The addition of beta-blocker reducesQTc prolongation and diminishes the risk of VT at the expense,however, of increased bradycardic events.

Gooderham, A. Soames, J.C. Rice, A.R. This condition may cause symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, dizziness, or palpitations if the heart rate becomes too fast to pump an adequate supply of blood to the body. Sinus tachycardia is often transient, occurring when the body is under stress from , strong emotions, , or dehydration, to name a few causes. Once the stress is removed, the heart rate will usually return to its usual rate.: Sinus tachycardia exercise fever The Elusive Pathophysiology of

As members of the animal phylum Arthropoda, all insects (the class Insecta) have jointed limbs (arthropoda means "jointed feet") and an exoskeleton. Lepidopterans are characterized by the presence of pigment-bearing scales on their wings, and it is these scales that produce their distinctive colors and patterns. The name actually means "scaly-winged." When a person touches the wings of a butterfly or moth, some of these scales rub off, producing the "dust" that is spoken of as coming from moths.

Most moths are nocturnal but seem to be attracted to light (for example, a porch light or a fire). One reason is that because moths are , they navigate, or find their way around by using the moon as a point of reference. Moths can become confused by any other
light source and they basically get "lost". although most moths are nocturnal, some species are
active during the day if you type the word "moth" over and over, it starts to look funny . . . moth moth moth moth AND MOST IPORTANT there is a genus of moths, the Calyptra genus, that in addition to piecring fruit for the juice SUCK BLOOD The cuticle of the hornworm gradually becomes darker and harder, and eventually is replaced by the hard, mahogany-colored pupal case. The tongue (proboscis) is an obvious feature on the pupal case. Some musculature is present during the pupal stage; if picked up or disturbed, the posterior end of the pupa will wiggle (this can be quite disturbing to students if they are not expecting it).

In France they are called 'papillon.' Parking tickets are called 'papillon' too, because they are big pieces of yellow paper.

Larvae or caterpillars have voracious appetites and a single larva can eat a whole leaf in a single day. Larvae can take from 10 days to two months to become big enough to enter the pupa stage. Inside the pupa the larva slowly transforms into an adult butterfly. This can take from eight days to several months depending on the species of the butterfly and the time of the year. The source of this data is from miscellanoues literature (old and new) of varying quality, and often using conflicting organizations. The result is sometimes confusing and . At this point I'm only trying to get the taxa included.the organization here must not be taken as any taxonomic statement or study The addition of my records from over 20 years of light trapping is still at idea stage. Female moths use special scent chemicals  called pheromones  to attract a mate and the males can detect the smell of a waiting female with amazing accuracy over great distances. Many products are now available
which make use of this,
using pheromones as bait to lure males into a sticky trap  the idea being to break the breeding cycle, thus controlling the infestation.

the eye can see to snatch prey. The strong mouthparts can cut through even heavily armored heads of insects, and these fearsome predators are voracious eaters.

startup kits in . HERE The Nature Store However, when just "cruising" moths need cues that will allow them to maintain appropriate orientation to surrounding objects, the ground, etc., and one of the cues that is consistent for moths is that light sources (back before the
advent of human-made light sources) were predictably"UP" (in the sky). The moon is not always at a consistent angle upward in the sky, but it always up, as are the stars.is The caterpillar molts (loses its old skin) many times as it grows.Larva - It turns into a pupa (chrysalis); this is a resting stage.Pupa - A beautiful, flying adult emerges.

Only twice seen on the reserve; the first in June 1983 and the next in May 1997. Contrary to it's name, this species will feed on English elm, alder and birch. All three species can be found in small quantities at Gibraltar Point making colonisation by the lime hawk-moth a possibility. Convolvulous Hawk-Moth  ( )Agrius convolvuli    As with the
privet hawk-moth this is
really one of the 'giants' of
those hawk-moths which occur in the British Isles. Thus the stage of moth development that is most often encountered by ordinary people by day is the caterpillar. Actually, very few Australian moths have English common names, as there have been only 200 years or so of English settlement in Australia. Even the moth families are usually referred to by derivatives of their scientific names in Australia.

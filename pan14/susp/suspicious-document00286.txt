There is great potential in combining
geographically oriented accessibility
research and geometrically oriented research in architecture, such as , as stated by for example, Jiang et al. The weak representations of the cognitive environment for movement space in current accessibility measures, pointed out by for example Kwan et al, can be reinforced by the concept of the axial line, developed by Hillier
et al. The axial line represents how you move and what you can see, which is by nature directional. He has made 12,000 overlay maplets of Eros from images produced by the NEAR spacecraft at the turn of the
century. In all, NEAR made 160,000 digital images, and Im doing 1,000 at a time, Dr. Gaskell said. Dr. Gaskell calls what he does stereophotoclinometry. Ideally he needs at least three images of the target landscape, usually taken by an orbiting spacecraft or a probe on a flyby to another destination. Only in rare cases can telescope images provide
enough detail. Some online
applications that allow the user to zoom into an area often include locator maps to assist in navigating the main map or image. For example, uses a locator map to orient visitors to its site, included as a
toggle button. These locators often feature a movable box that assists the user with
navigating the main map. The tool uses spatial data on plot regions or address points. The axial map with unlinks constitute the grid. Address points also work as links between plot and axial line. Distance (dij) can be constrained as 'turns' (axial
steps), walk distance
or bird's distance (meter).
There are also possibilities to
define a function on the distance constraints.
Common ways include
varying the tone of the background color, or by
running a weak line along the zone

He published a map of the world in 1569 based on this projection. Many other map projections were soon developed.

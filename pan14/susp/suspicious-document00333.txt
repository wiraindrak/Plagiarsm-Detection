The data packets flow into providers' servers, and are then transferred through
Cable to the customer's home. The customer's cable modem receives the high-speed transmission, and the Ethernet card translates the data to your computer.

Services aim to keep customers loyal, expand business by entering new markets, and capture market share from companies that were not traditionally their competitors. And technology
suppliers hope to sell a range of enabling tools, software, and integration projects to service providers that may have little expertise in their new lines of business. Existing services pose barriers to entry to competitors. But competitors perceive a strategic need to advance their own plans to offer bundles. If customers adopt fixed-mobile bundles offered by fixed-line telcos, cellular-only competitors can respond by supporting voice-over-DSL using preexisting home Wi-Fi networks. Emerging portable broadband services will try to provide full-featured voice and fast Internet connections, both at home and in mobile environmentsand fixedline telcos may try to repurpose their wireless local-loop spectrum to match the offer.

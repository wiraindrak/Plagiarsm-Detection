medical condition that can be treated.  The good news is
that the recently completed Diabetes Prevention Program
study conclusively showed that people
with pre-diabetes can prevent the
development
of type 2 diabetes by
making changes
in their
diet
and increasing their level of physical
activity.
They may even be able to return
their blood glucose levels to the
normal range. While the DPP also showed that some
medications may delay the
development
of diabetes, diet and exercise worked better. Just
30 minutes a day
of moderate physical
activity,
coupled with a 5-10% reduction in body weight,
produced a 58%
reduction
in diabetes. There are a variety of courses available for

THEN?Automatic Ball Trap / Universal
Trench / Olympic Trap.  Generally these disciplines are the same, the variations
are mainly in the number of traps used,
one/five/fifteen.  In ABT, there is one trap oscillating
horizontally
and
vertically within a prescribed range.  In UT there are five traps set at differing angles and heights, again within limits.  OT requires a complex range where 15 traps are set-up in a trench. The 15 traps are made up of 5 sets of three, each trio of traps projects a target to the centre left and right. Some competitions have four rounds / 100 targets. However the winner isn't determined at the end of this. The shooters with the top five scores take place in a 25 target shoot
off which decides the winner.  Blimey!! WHAT ABOUT THE BEST GUN FOR THE JOB?If you are serious about this discipline then the gun of choice is a trap gun with a tight choke set-up. - is operated by moving the forearm in a rearward motion, followed by a forward motion. This action unlocks the breechblock, extracts and ejects the fired shot shell, transfers a live shell from the magazine to the chamber and re-locks the breechblock."The pump gun - is so named because all you do is pull the trigger and the gun takes care of ejecting the spent shell and
chambering the new one all on its own. There are two basic
types of automatic shotguns.
1) the gas-operated and 2) the recoil-operated. As you might guess
the basic difference is whether or not the expanding gases from the shot shell are used as part of the cycling process of the gun. Gas-operated Shotguns tend to have less recoil while
recoil-operated guns tend to jam less.The semi automatic CARTRIDGE CHOICE? Basically there is only one cartridge to use, a high performance plastic wad trap cartridge. Size say 7 or 7 ADVICE?Even though the average target speed is much higher than other disciplines, there is still no need to panic. Keep
a cool head and you will still have
enough time to get two clear shots off. Rush your shots and
things
will only be worse. email Welcome
to the Andover Historic Preservation Web Site Andover was settled in 1636 under
the Native American name
of Cochichawicke, a local waterway. The community was
incorporated
in 1646 as the Town of Andover, named after a town in England where many of its settlers originated. Andover’s economic base evolved from agriculture to industry during the 18th century. Education became an important local “industry” with the establishment of three academic institutions. Phillips Academy, founded in 1770, is one of the nation’s oldest preparatory schools. Abbott Academy, established in 1828 as one of New England’s first female academies, merged with Phillips Academy in 1973. The Andover Theological Seminary (1807), now part of Andover Newton Theological Seminary and the oldest graduate school of theology in the United States, was responsible for
the
American
missionary
movement. Past Shooters Events  The 2 Shot Past Shooter

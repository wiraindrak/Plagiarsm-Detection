day, Defenders are helping to save lives, deliver medical care and service industry in areas that only a Defender can survive.   From the poles to the equator, the Defender has proven itself to have no equal. Supreme traction and agility enables Defender to climb and descend the steepest of slopes  even in reverse gear, while a wide choice of gearing allows you to power uphill or to crawl competently and safely at extreme angles over loose
earth.   Efficient engine braking, matched to a precise transmission means that even
descending a 45 degree slope is easy work as Defender advances confidently just on engine tickover. A ground-gripping handbrake controlling all four wheels makes Defender the ultimate
anchor-man whether hauling lifeboats from the sea or winching over terrain that would be otherwise impassable. For those who need the power and strength to pull heavy loads, the Defender's stance, traction and
grip makes it the
world's favourite tow vehicle. Chassis numberson Land Rovers can lead to you obtaining quite a bit
of information on your vehicle. On the other hand, if you own something like a IIA where the serial number prefix didn't

Land Rover was sold around 2000 by the then owners BMW to its present owners Ford and now forms part of the Premier Automotive Group (PAG), joining Aston Martin, Jaguar, Lincoln and Volvo. The home of the Land Rover remains the same at the Lode Lane factory in Solihull where the first Land Rovers were produced over 50 years ago with separate production lines now handling the Range Rover, Discovery, Defender
and Freelander. This metal's resistance to corrosion was one of the factors that allowed the vehicle to build up a reputation for longevity in the toughest conditions. It is reckoned that 75% of all those ever built are still in use. In
fact, Land Rover drivers[13] sometimes refer to other makes of 4x4 as "disposables". The early
choice of colour was dictated by military surplus supplies of aircraft cockpit paint, so early
vehicles only came in various shades of light green; all models until recently feature sturdy box section ladder-frame chassis. Your drive for customizing your vehicle with Defender parts and Defender accessories is high, and so is our drive to seek out new and imaginative products for you. The Defender 90 3.9 litre V8 convertible marked Land Rover's
mass-production return to the U.S. market. It ran into trouble with the government because its design didn't include
airbags. A major retrofit being impractical at that time, Land Rover stopped importing them to
these shores.

He discovered a need for the vehicle when using his own , (an old war jeep) on his farm in . Parts for this were available but could only be bought in bulk due to the army's

lines, which are much easier to run before installing the body. Another often
overlooked part of the swap is the steering
relay. The men at Land Rover were naturally delighted at this vote of confidence, which they knew was perfectly justified. Despite this, however, there was bound to be the nagging suspicion among some devout Land Rover enthusiasts that the Range Rover was a
car for dilettantes
and could hardly be expected to be as tough or as versatile as the original. This
was loosely based on the existing 2.5 litre turbo unit, but had a modern alloy cylinder head, improved turbo charging,
intercooling and direct injection. The 200 Tdi as it was called produced 107
horsepower (111 in the Discovery), and 188 lb-ft of torque (195 lb-ft in the
Discovery), which was nearly a 25% improvement on the engine it replaced. Therefore, when the first Range Rovers - distinguished by a new grille design - entered the U.S. on March 16, 1987, all were fitted with air conditioning, cruise control and automatic transmission as standard. However these
cars, for all their comforts, could still traverse the roughest terrain in the time-honored Land Rover tradition.

reputation has been built over the last 60 years on the manufacture of robust and
dependable vehicles that can tackle any driving condition in any terrain – and this was the inspiration for the spectacular Central Feature
Sculpture. For me, this is one of the most awe-inspiring and memorable
displays we have ever had at the Festival. It's arguably our most artistic too, with its naturally rusted steel structure. It is certainly magnificent," commented Lord March at the reveal last night. Land Rover, this year's featured marque, will celebrate its

The government had effective power
over the car manufacturers by strictly controlling the supply of steel, without which, production would be out of the
question. In the hope that these restrictions would
eventually be lifted, the Rover engineers prepared a novel small car design. But as soon as it
became apparent that rationing would continue and supplies would be allocated in proportion to the number of cars exported (thereby earning foreign
currency), it became obvious that a small car for the U.K.

and as a consequence all Land Rovers were (and Defenders still are) built with aluminium body panels. This is one reason why the older generation Land Rovers and the ever-popular Defender
models still hold their value because the body panels themselves are not prone to corrosion. The Land Rover range has improved and expanded over the years to meet both civilian and military demands.

109" Land Rover, but have had to sell it. These pages were developed during my ownership and are being kept online in-case they are of use to anyone else. Recently, a has been added. Land Rover History When I lived in the UK, my "car" was a little unusual, in that it was an ex-MoD Series 3 109" Land Rover. The British Army took delivery in January 1973,
making it a little older than myself. After being passed around the regiments and a couple of stints in Northern Ireland
during the
1970s (probably as a reserve vehicle), it joined the Gurkha Rifles where it stayed until being de-mobbed in 1989. A mild
facelift of revised grille styling and the fitting of wheel arch extensions to cover
the
wider-track axles are the most noticeable changes. Also the windscreen was made larger and came as one piece. The grille was moved forward, as it was on the stage 1, to allow sufficient space in the engine
compartment for
the Rover V8 as well as the new engines planned. Inside, the furnishings were improved, and the
rear load space was increased by restricting
the boxed-in sections to the wheel arches only. Leaf springs were
replaced by coil spring suspension, which gave a more comfortable ride
when the vehicle was lightly laden and also improved axle articulation. Over the years
with the need for increased protection the design was evolved using the new Land Rover Defender 110 Chassis. The latest evolution of the design was the introduction of the Tangi. Land Rover Shorland armoured car Known locally as a "meat wagon", the vehicles
are synonymous with Northern Ireland's Troubles. At the height of the Troubles the vehicles were essential for patrolling across Northern Ireland. At this time they were painted a plain grey. A number of people were killed after being hit
by the vehicles during the Troubles, usually in riot situations. This trend was most
noticeable in the U.S., where the Land Rover found itself at the forefront of a burgeoning market - the sport utility vehicle. The survey coincided neatly with a project
called the 100-Inch Station Wagon which was developed under the direction of Spen King. His idea was to build something which combined the comfort, silence and road performance of Rover cars with the off-road capability of a Land Rover. This was a difficult challenge, but one with which the Land Rover engineering teams quickly came to grips.

His first Land Rover was made in 1947, a hybrid built on a Jeep chassis using a Rover
car engine and gearbox but retaining the Jeep transmission. This first prototype had a centrally mounted steering wheel so
that the driver sat astride the gearbox rather like
driving a tractor. Once we were on the mainland, we drove east through
Tepic, Guadalajara, Mexico City, Puebla, and Veracruz to Villahermosa  a city in the Mexican state of Tabasco.  Villahermosa is on the Caribbean side, and there we met up with a large group of other Rover owners from the US who had come
by another route. Getting two vehicles

export-hungry Rover
Company. The creators of the Land Rover were Spencer Wilks, then managing director of
Rover, and his brother, Maurice, then engineering director. Since the Good Friday Agreement and the resulting peace, the vehicles are largely used for crowd control, particularly during contested Orange Order parades. The vehicles are now painted in white, yellow and blue battenburg pattern, as seen on the majority of police vehicles throughout the United Kingdom. More than half of the former RUC (now PSNI) fleet of 450 armoured Land Rovers were decommissioned under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement - a number came back to the mainland to be refurbished and distributed
among UK
forces. For instance, they are now in use with the West Yorkshire and North Wales police services. [2] [3] The vehicle has become popular with collectors.

 Shipping your Land Rover Chassis The beginning of a new direction emerged following the
arrival of
a new Managing Director, Michael (later Sir Michael) Edwards in 1978. One of his first
actions
was to split the British Leyland car business into two semi-autonomous groups,
one of which was Jaguar-Rover-Triumph Ltd. This group in turn was sub-divided into Jaguar Cars, Rover-Triumph and Land
Rover Limited. At last, the four-wheel-drive part of the business was able to receive the attention it deserved, with a management team able to fight for Land Rover's investment and production needs. By this time, Range Rovers were so much in demand that a "black market" had formed, with customers prepared to pay dealers over the asking price in order to jump the lengthy waiting list. Service

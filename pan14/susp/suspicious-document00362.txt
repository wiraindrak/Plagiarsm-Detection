visitors have been successful. So maybe they
were not off the mark. In Russia they're called 'babochka' or 'little soul'. The ancient Greeks called butterflies 'Psyche' which also means 'soul.' Many cultures feel that when we die our souls go to heaven as
butterflies. In France they are
called 'papillon.'
Parking tickets are called 'papillon' too, because they are big pieces of yellow paper. The LIFE-CYCLE OF A BUTTERFLY Butterflies and moths undergo complete metamorphosis in which they go through four different life stages. - A butterfly starts its life as an egg.Egg - The larva (caterpillar) hatches from an egg and eats leaves or flowers almost constantly. The caterpillar molts (loses its old skin) many times as it grows.Larva - It turns into a pupa (chrysalis); this is a resting stage.Pupa - A beautiful, flying adult emerges. There is no growth during this stage. This adult will continue the cycle and reproduce.Adult Butterfly Life Cycle Printouts and Activities Print your own copy of a butterfly's lifecycle from
egg to larva to pupa to adult. Butterfly Life Cycle Printout The aquatic larvae of some species are free swimming predators, some spin silken nets to trap vegetable matter in fast-moving water, and still others construct portable shelters out of sand grains, bits of shell, or even plant fragments. These larva are called casemakers, and each genus has a distinctive style and construction method. Trout and other fishermen value the casemaker as bait for sport fish.Order Trichoptera Caddisflies We have several articles on butterfly and moth biology in our article index, including their life

caterpillars are often made conspicuous by the damage they do to plants, as the caterpillars of many moth species are important agricultural pests. Thus the stage of moth development that is most often encountered by ordinary people by day is the caterpillar.
Actually, very few Australian moths have English common names, as there have been only 200 years or so of English settlement in Australia. Even the moth families are usually referred to by derivatives of their scientific names in Australia. The situation is very different from that in Europe and America where most common moth species have common names. The pupal stage in Manduca sexta lasts approximately two weeks. The adult hawkmoth is a large, nocturnal moth. In flight, hawkmoths can easily be
mistaken for hummingbirds because of
their large
wingspan. Hawkmoths are generalist nectar feeders, and
feed through a very long proboscis, which is curled up
in a spiral when not feeding. Approximately 3 or 4 days after hatching, female moths can begin ovipositing eggs on leaf surfaces.     Geoff Collins is an amateur aviation photographer. He bought his first SLR camera when he was 17, and he has taken aviation photos for over 30 years. He tries to make his photos artistic, rather than pure records. Even when the grass is wet, he can be seen on his knees trying to get the best angle. Having taken similar shots to others whilst behind the fence line at air displays, he now spends his time with aviation minded people helping them to enjoy Tiger Moth pleasure flights, and at de Havilland Moth Club events. He also loves taking photos of Yaks in formation, but that is another story. His favourite photographer is Charles E Brown.ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPHER: To buy a picture please

In recent years political conditions have emerged in basin countries that have provided a window of opportunity for taking forwards cooperative development of the shared waters. With the support of external agencies, since the late 1990s nine of the 10 Nile riparian countries have been setting in train a process of institutional development that has cemented cooperation and charted a way forward for future development in the Nile Basin. 5 Nile-TACthmeeting held in and second meeting of the Working Groups to develop Project Concept Documents (PCD), for the Shared Vision Program project portfolio in preparation

Links Introduction Over a period of several years the ten countries of the Nile have come together within the Nile Basin Initiative to develop and implement program in terms of a shared vision which they have agreed to. The shared vision is "”to achieve sustainable socio-economic development through the equitable utilization of, and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water resources. The countries of the Nile Basin are :- Burundi Uganda Projects and programs The Nile Basin Initiative Strategic Action Program contains two main types of projects - Those to be planned and
undertaken at Basin level with all the riparian countries involved called the
"Shared Vision Program" (SVP), and those to be undertaken between two or more countries at subsidiary level, called "Subsidiary Action
Programs" (SAP). This is
considered to be a nice day out to enjoy with a large number of friends or family. The River Nile breeze in Summer or winter will awaken your senses. Though, we recommend a night or sunset Nile River trip by boat or nile cruise in the Summer time for a cooler Summer breeze, and a daytime nile river cruise in winter time to enjoy the Sun warmth.

Conservation Agreements and Planning in Idaho It is estimated that two-thirds of our nation's lands are privately owned. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recognizes that the key to ensuring healthy fish, wildlife and plants and their habitats rests in the hands of private
landowners. These basins were not interconnected except
after their subsidence
ceased and the rate of sediment
deposition was enough to
fill up the basins to such a level that would allow connection to take place. The filling up of the depressions led to the connection of the Egyptian Nile with the Sudanese Nile, which captures the Ethiopian and Equatorial head waters during the latest stages of tectonic activities of Eastern, Central and Sudanese Rift Systems. The connection of the different Niles occurred during the cyclic wet periods. The fact that this right exists means that any perceived reduction of the Nile water supply to Egypt is tampering with its national
security and thus could trigger potential conflict.
There have been occasions when Egypt has threatened to go to war over Nile
water. This is has been always because of a threat to Egypt's water supply by neighbouring states. Sudan also has hydraulic
potential and has created four dams in the last century. This has resulted in the development so far of 18,000 km of irrigated land, making Sudan the second most extensive user of the Nile, after Egypt.

It was formally launched in February, 1999 by the water ministers of 9 countries that share the river - Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia,Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda as well as Eritrea. Eritrea, which shares only a very small portion of the Nile Basin, is not participating actively in the Initiative it assumes an observer role. The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) is led by the riparian states of the Nile River through the Council of Ministers of Water Affairs of the Nile Basin states (Nile Council of Ministers, or Nile-COM). Recognizing that cooperative development holds the greatest prospects for bringing benefits to the entire region, and aware of the challenges - the initiative provides an institutional mechanism, a shared vision, and a set of agreed policy
guidelines to provide a basinwide framework for cooperative action.
Egypt into the Mediterranean Sea Where is the source of the Nile? The Ruvyironza River of Burundi is regarded as the true and ultimate source of the Nile. The Ruvyironza is one of the upper branches of the Kagera River, which follows the Rwanda-Tanzania and Uganda-Tanzania borders into Lake Victoria. The source of the Nile is sometimes considered to be Lake Victoria, but the lake itself has feeder rivers of considerable size like the Kagera River.

Only 100 to 200 mm of rain falls on the delta area during an average year, and most of this falls in the winter months. The delta experiences its hottest temperatures in July and August, averaging 30 C, with a maximum of around 48 C. Winter temperatures are normally in the range of 5 to 10 C.

Introduction The Nile is one of the worlds greatest riches and is of inestimable value for its peoples  a resource which needs to be held in trust for future generations. Sustainable development and management of the Nile Basin presents a great challenge and there remain many
opportunities for growth and development for the future, bringing the promise of regional harmony and economic development. At the heart of this challenge is the imperative to
eradicate poverty. Susenyos Gorgora Lake

His account of Ethiopia, in 1620, has been printed as Volumes II and III of Beccari's (Rome,
1905-17). It is based on distributed hydrological and socio-economic modelling within a GIS, an approach which has been already used with some success in other regions. The first stage of the project focused on the compilation of available geoferenced data sets of the Nile valley region to be used as inputs for water balance modeling. It led to the elaboration of a first report, which gives an introduction the UNEP/DEWA/GRID-Europe Nile River Basin project. Available georeferenced data sets have been stored in ArcInfo/ArcView. They serve as inputs for water
balance modelling, which was carried out with a view to identifying potential water problem areas. General data on transboundary water sharing and on the Nile River Basin have been collected. Cairo, El-Fayoum, Aswan, Luxor, Aswan, are among the most important & major cities in Egypt that are located on boarders of the Nile River, while Alexandria, Damietta and Port Said are from the cities that lies near the Rosetta Nile River branch. Aswan High Dam is the major dam on the River Nile.

Strategic Action Program represents the Nile riparians strategic approach to achieving sustainable socioeconomic development in the basin through equitable utilization of, and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water resources. The Strategic Action Program provides the means for translating this shared vision into concrete activities through a two-fold, complementary approach: Lay the groundwork for cooperative action through a regional program to build confidence and capacity throughout the basin (the Shared Vision Program) Pursue, simultaneously, cooperative development opportunities to realize physical investments and tangible results through sub-basin activities (Subsidiary action programs) in the Eastern Nile and the Nile Equatorial Lakes regions. Some of the projects will be 'soft' comprising capacity building, confidence building, policy development etc., whilst others are likely to comprise 'hard' development of infrastructure, river management, flood protection, watershed restitution, hydropower etc.. These projects will have an
impact on the people of the
Basin and on global interests - it is important that as wide a group as possible are involved in this process. Activities In the IUCN, WWF and World Bank jointly hosted a workshop in the IUCN Headquarters in Gland, Switzerland, which was financed by the Rockefeller Foundation, in order to investigate the establishment of an International Discourse on the Nile.

The NBRP will serve as an overall framework and catalyst for activities and initiatives reflecting research and educational priorities of Nile Basin researchers.The programme targets both post doctoral and senior researchers at institutions of research and higher education in the Nile Basin countries and is complementary to
the ATP in adding a research component
to the programme. The programme is associated with the Applied Training
Programme (ATP) under Nile Basin
Initiative’s (NBI) Shared Vision Programme (SVP). The Nile had no effect upon The Exodus because it was located west of the Israelites' starting point. They were of course headed east, toward The Promised Land, so the Nile would have been behind them right from the start. The body of water that they would be concerned with (but was parted for them) was the Red Sea, 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of the Nile. (see and ) Where Did They Cross The Sea? With long running disputes continuing over Syria, the two great empires were destined to end their quarrels in conflict. In the Egyptian king Rameses II marched his
armies north, where he
encountered the Hittite armies
of king Muwatalli at the city of Kadesh. After an initial Hittite victory, followed by a successful Egyptian counter offence, the two armies ended in a stalemate that lasted 16 years. The conflict concluded with a peace treaty, both sides worried about the growing power of Assyria who were in the process of overthrowing and destroying the cities of their former rulers, the Mitanni.

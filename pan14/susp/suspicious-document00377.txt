Federal and State Equal Opportunity
Requirements Equal Opportunity Requirements Standard Title: Noncompliance with Federal and State Equal Opportunity Requirements       A pattern or practice of noncompliance by
a sponsor (or where the sponsor is a joint apprenticeship committee, by one of the parties represented on such committee) with
Federal or state laws or regulations requiring equal opportunity may be grounds for the imposition of sanctions in accordance with
30.13 if such
noncompliance is related to the equal employment opportunity of
apprentices and/or graduates of such an
apprenticeship program under this part. Prohibited
discrimination and
harassment generally carry a component of
power differential between individuals; therefore, a person who seems to acquiesce to discriminatory or harassing conduct may still
be considered a victim of prohibited
harassment. Prohibited discrimination and
harassment can
occur between an employee and a manager; between
co-workers; between faculty members;
between a faculty, staff, or student and a customer, patient, vendor, or
contractor;
between a student and a faculty member
or another student; between men and

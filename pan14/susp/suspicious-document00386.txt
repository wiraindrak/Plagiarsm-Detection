(654 km⊃2;) to
415,000 acres
(1,680 km⊃2;). The size of
individual vineyards in the New World is significant. Europe's 1.6 million vineyards are an average of 0.2 square kilometres each, while the average Australian vineyard is 0.5 square kilometres, providing considerable economies of scale. The varying colors, heights, and textures contrast with the nearby lawn, highlighting the shape of the ground-cover bed. Some ground covers also grow where no grass can thrive. In shady areas under trees, dead nettle and periwinkles are at home. On steep banks, where lawn mowing is difficult, great-looking daylilies or junipers can grow thickly enough to stop erosion. As such, they are often

does not mix well with blood -- similar to oil and water. To help cholesterol travel through blood to get where it is needed, the body wraps it within water-soluble proteins. This mixture of fatty cholesterol and protein is known as a "lipoprotein." The good and the bad You will generally hear about two types, often called the "good cholesterol" and the "bad cholesterol": -- HDL stands for High-Density Lipoproteins. These are
composed mainly of proteins with only small amounts of cholesterol. We also demonstrated that the kinetics ofVLDL triglycerides and apoB are closely coupled. Our data donot support a role for plasma apoA-V in regulating VLDL kinetics.Conclusions We investigated the associations between plasma VLDL-apoC-IIIand apoA-V
concentrations and the kinetics of VLDL-apoB-100and VLDL triglyceride in 15 men. Increased VLDL-apoC-III concentrationsresulting from an overproduction of VLDL-apoC-III was a predictorof the delayed catabolism of VLDL triglyceride and VLDL-apoB.However, apo-V concentration was not significantly associatedwith VLDL

Cholesterol catalysts: Good Cholesterol and Bad Cholesterol At this point, the nascent VLDL becomes a mature VLDL. Once in circulation, the VLDL will come in contact with (LPL) in the capillary beds in the body (adipose, cardiac, and skeletal muscle). The LPL will remove triglycerides from the VLDL for storage or energy production. apolipoprotein C-II apolipoprotein E High-Density Lipoprotein lipoprotein lipase The VLDL now meets
back up with HDL where apoC-II is transferred back to the HDL (but keeps apoE). In addition to this, the HDL transfers cholesteryl esters to the VLDL in exchange for phospholipids and triglycerides (via ). cholesteryl ester transfer protein As more and more triglycerides are removed from the VLDL because of the action of the LPL enzyme, the composition of the molecule changes, and it becomes intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL).   There are also a number of foods that, while not considered foods that lower cholesterol, do reduce the chances for developing . heart disease   (Click for more information on foods --

Common Job Interview Questions - Part II   Have you got any questions? Usually asked at the end of the interview Tactics to answer this question: Do not state no because they have already answered them, because this can sound weak, or that you are not bothered making the effort. Make sure that you have prepared a list of possible questions, BEFORE you go to the interview. To prepare for this question, you will need to undertake some general research on the organisation. For a list of possible questions to ask, read our article Questions to Ask During a Job Interview What are some of the things that bothered you about your last job? This question is usually asked to identify whether some of the perceived problems of job you are applying for, are going to be a problem for you. This condition is called .   The Numbers LDL is the main source of damaging buildup and blockage in the arteries. Therefore, the more you have in your blood, the greater your risk of . But how much is too much? cholesterol heart disease   Your "healthy" LDL will depend on how many other you have. Like LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol is considered a type of
"bad" cholesterol because elevated levels are associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease. It is important to know your VLDL cholesterol level. However, there is no simple, direct way to measure VLDL cholesterol. So VLDL cholesterol is usually estimated as a percentage of your triglyceride value. A normal VLDL cholesterol level is between 5 and 40 milligrams per deciliter. Anti-cardiac troponin I (cTnI) monoclonal antibodywas obtained from Biogenesis (England, UK).

These colors look both professional and keep the focus of the interview on you and what you are saying.A complete guide to including finding out the company dress code and interview dress do's and dont's. For women a more personal touch can be included by using appropriate feminine colors like ice blue, lilac, a dusty or soft pink and a soft green as part of the mix. In general, the density of the lipoprotein increases as the proportion of apolipoprotein increases. Small amounts of cholesterol may be transported as part of chylomicrons, but cholesterol is usually
carried within lipoproteins, including low density lipoprotein (LDL), which carries cholesterol from the liver to muscle and other tissues, and high density lipoprotein (HDL), which carries cholesterol to the liver for conversion to bile acids. Physicians are especially concerned when patients have high levels of LDL (the so-called bad cholesterol) in blood; moderate exercise and low-cholesterol diets help to increase HDL (the so-called good cholesterol). Either high fat intake or problems with transport of cholesterol can lead to atherosclerosis, which in turn can contribute to heart attack (myocardial infarction) or stroke. ; ; .

When the HDL is greater than 1, this has the effect of lowering the TC/HDL ratio, lowering your risk. When the HDL is low, the TC/HDL ratio goes up and so does your risk. How can I lower my cholesterol levels? Most cholesterol in the body is produced in the liver. This means dieting only has a small effect on levels. Even so, this amount is still helpful, especially as part of a healthier diet in general. Some

How important is it to know my VLDL cholesterol level? - Rajeev / India Mayo Clinic cardiologist and colleagues answer select questions from readers. Thomas Behrenbeck, M.D., Answer Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol is one of the three major types of lipoproteins. The other two are high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Each type contains a mixture of cholesterol, protein and
triglyceride, but in varying amounts. LDL contains the highest amount of cholesterol. HDL contains the highest amount of protein.

LDL LDL, also known as "bad" cholesterol, is a substance used to transport cholesterol throughout the body. This eMedTV page explains how too much of this cholesterol in the blood can build up on artery walls and lead to problems, like a heart attack. HDL Your body needs HDL (a type of
cholesterol) to function properly. This page of the eMedTV archives provides a detailed look at this type of
cholesterol, including what it does, what the numbers mean, and how you can increase it in your system.
Previous studies have examined lipoprotein metabolism by macrophages following prolonged exposure (>24h) to macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). Because M-CSF activates several signaling pathways that could rapidly affect lipoprotein metabolism, we examined whether acute exposure of macrophages to M-CSF alters
the metabolism of either native or modified lipoproteins. Acute incubation of cultured J774 macrophages and resident mouse peritoneal macrophages with M-CSF markedly enhanced LDL and -VLDL stimulated cholesteryl [H]oleate deposition. In parallel, M-CSF treatment increased the association and degradation of [I]-labeled LDL or -VLDL without altering the amount of lipoprotein bound to the cell surface. The increase in LDL and -VLDL metabolism did not reflect a generalized effect on lipoprotein endocytosis and metabolism because M-CSF did not alter cholesterol deposition during incubation with acetylated LDL. Purpose of VLDL VLDL is made in the liver in response to a high-carbohydrate meal. The liver converts the extra carbohydrates into fat () and puts them into VLDLs to be transported to fat cells and muscle within the body. The liver also puts some into the VLDL. A VLDL particle is rather large, carrying a
lot of triglycerides
relative to the amount of cholesterol. triglycerides cholesterol Although the body needs some triglycerides, high levels in the blood can be a serious health problem and a risk factor for heart
disease. For most people, a
normal level would be under 150 mg/dL.   What Are Triglycerides? Triglycerides are the main storage form of fat in the body, and they are very important for the overall functioning of the body. They are used:   As building blocks for cells.   They have a very important function, in that most cells in the body use triglycerides for energy. (One notable exception is the brain cells, which do not use them for energy.) They are the most concentrated form of energy found within the body, producing more than twice the amount of energy per
gram than other forms of energy -- protein and carbohydrates. This is why the body can store large amounts of triglycerides. Typical Interview Questions and Best Answers Here are more .

Foods containing plant sterols, plant
stanols, or soluble fiber
have been shown to
lower cholesterol. Scientists believe that when soluble fiber is digested, it sticks to cholesterol and prevents it from being absorbed. Until recently, foods high in soy protein were also thought to be foods for lowering cholesterol; however, recent research has shown this is not the case. Shoes should be tasteful and not the first thing the interviewer notices about you. The best suit colors for men are solid navy, beige or gray. Subtle pinstripes or plaid may also be acceptable. Men can include a pastel colored shirt to lift the neutral color of their suit or pants or add a distinctive tie. Shirt colors should
always be lighter than the tie. Busy prints and loud colors are overwhelming and look unprofessional. Men's shoes should either be black or dark brown leather. Socks should be the same color as the suit and long enough so that your legs don't show when you sit. Fit Fit is all important when selecting the most appropriate
clothes for your job interview. Pants should be fitted but not tight. This IDL can return to the liver with its cholesterol so that the liver can repackage it to use it later or simply get rid of it. But in most cases, the IDLs remain in the blood and go
through another
transformation where they lose most of
their remaining triglycerides. At this point, the IDLs are almost all cholesterol and are now known as . About three-quarters of total cholesterol in the blood is contained within LDL particles. LDL   Causes of Increased VLDL Levels Normal VLDL cholesterol level is between 5 and 40 mg/dL. Note: Normal value ranges may vary
slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean High levels may be associated with a higher risk for heart disease and stroke.

B. Triglycerides: Triglycerides are predominantly carried in the blood stream by very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). There is, however, considerable heterogeneity of triglyceride-rich particles. Triglyceride-rich particles derived from dietary fat, chylomicrons, are not themselves
associated with CHD, but, when very high (>1,000 mg/dl) can cause pancreatitis. However, these chylomicron particles are gradually reduced in size by lipoprotein lipase to intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) which are atherogenic. Similarly, VLDL from the liver is reduced in size by lipoprotein lipase, producing atherogenic IDL. VLDL predicts progression of coronary artery disease and CHD events. Fax machine and

After a cell has used the cholesterol for its chemical needs and doesn't need any more, it reduces its number of LDL receptors. This enables LDL levels to accumulate in the blood. When this happens, the LDLs
begin to
deposit cholesterol on artery walls, forming thick plaques. In contrast, the HDLs--the "good" guys--act to remove this excess cholesterol and transport it to the liver for disposal.

Lipoprotein
complexes usually have a lipid core surrounded by one or more apolipoprotein molecules. These complexes can be separated into classes according to density. They range from very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), having densities of less than 1.006 g/mL, to low density lipoproteins (LDL), having densities of between 1.019 and 1.063 g/mL, to high density lipoproteins (HDL), having densities of between 1.063 and 1.210 An angiogram of the carotid artery.

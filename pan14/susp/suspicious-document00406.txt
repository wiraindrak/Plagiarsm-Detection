Subtracting key issues from the gospel changes its essence. Warren discusses eternity on day four of his spiritual journey and uses it to introduce his version of the gospel. He tells his forty day pilgrims, f you learn to love and trust God Son, Jesus, you will be invited to spend the rest of eternity with him. They "(1) have a shared belief system, (2) sustain a high level of social cohesiveness, (3) are strongly influenced by the group's behavioral norms, and (4) impute charismatic (or sometimes divine) power to the group or its leadership" (Galanter 4).

Minneapolis Tom Prichard, President of the Minnesota Family Council (MFC) today, applauded the selection of California evangelical pastor Rick Warren to give the invocation at President-elect Obama inauguration next month. Now, I'm not saying that Warren isn't genuinely moderate, compared
to his rival "evangelical" Bible-thumpers. . . But Rick Warren is still a sick, twisted human being, and the smiling front-man for intolerably cruel and stupid policies. Intellectually and morally, he's several cuts below Jeremiah Wright (of whom I am by no means an admirer). Drawing simple but powerful truths from the Bible, this book gives you practical guidance for specific types of change, and it links you up with the power to actually make the changes you long to make. As you apply the
truth of God's Word by the power of the Spirit,
your life will change. But, in seeking inclusiveness, did he really have to include someone so divisive, who is himself against inclusion of the LGBT community in one of society's most revered institutions?

I will be happy to send a free copy of to anyone who can provide a prayer which, in the opinion of the judges (me) is at least more memorable and appropriate than those in the book. What is the problem? Man chose to rebel and ignore God's principles for living: * "Well, if it feels good, I will do it... I don't care what God has said!" * "This is my life and I will do what I like!" * "I don't need God, I only believe in myself!"

Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies [30] This is a must read book for any church pastor or church leader. Rick Warren has
basically written a book which details the methods he has used to grow a church of many thousands in West Coast well heeled well educated America.

If that doesnt sum up the difference between these two men on the abortion question, then I dont know what does. In fact, it ran opposite to Obama's theme of acceptance of all and finding ways to bring people together regardless of religious or political beliefs. No, instead this narrow minded pastor pushed out his two points that should never have been uttered on this magical day: A blessing for
Israel and the need to pray to (his lord) Jesus Christ. When religion enters the picture, we are a pluralistic society, not a Christian one.

from Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Warren headlined the annual service, and chanted their disapproval for the selection and the California pastor’s views against marriage equality and other progressive causes. The protest was the work of the Atlanta Black LGBT Coalition, GLBT ATL and other progressive groups who have spoken out forcefully against Warren’s inclusion in the events.

of ways. And, what happens if and when more is needed to get to any other desired level of atonement?I read the book, participated in the myriad of activities therein, and have recommended it to several of my friends.Personally, I came away convinced that this indeed is an excellent resourced for devout Christians (and non-Christains alike) who crave rejuvenation back to the roots of prayer and practice faith-base principles and initiatives.The Purpose Driven Life         How do preaching,

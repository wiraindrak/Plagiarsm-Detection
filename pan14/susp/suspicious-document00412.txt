Voyager 2 completed both of those missions and is currently performing scientific experiments in interstellar space. On the chance that someone is out there, NASA approved the placement of a phonograph record on each of the Voyager spacecraft. The recording, called "Sounds of Earth" fits on a 12-inch, copper disc

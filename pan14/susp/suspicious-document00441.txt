generic.a9.com Please keep in mind that I think search history is a great thing. I use it all the time on A9, and I think that many people would love to use it on Google. I don’t believe Yahoo has implemented it yet, but I can’t imagine it will be long before they do. I just prefer to be able to opt in, or out, of anything that tracks and records my personal data, that’s all. When I start my computer, the WeatherEye widget opens

Launches Web Analytics Published on October 12, 2008 by Jay Signorello Bookmark Yahoo! is launching a “web
analytics” service on a limited basis starting this
week, as reported by . The new service (currently in
beta and available to only a select handful of advertisers and third party application developers) is apparently the result of Yahoo’s acquisition of IndexTools earlier this year. Search Engine Land Jitendra Kavathekar, Yahoo’s VP of Web Analytics, said that the next “big deployment” will be for Yahoo’s Small Business service users, and that the service will continue to be rolled out this year and into 2009. Best of all…the service will be free! Really nice to see some more competition for Google in this space.

That business is all about making the Internet a nicer place to be by making the task of finding things much

because they considered themselves yahoos. Yahoo! itself first resided on Yang's student workstation, "akebono," while the search engine was lodged on Filo's computer, "konishiki." (These machines were named after legendary Hawaiian sumo wrestlers.) In early 1995 Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape Communications in Mountain View, California (and
the developer of the two most popular Web-browsers) invited Filo and Yang to move their files over to larger computers housed at Netscape. The email support is the mainstay of hosting services because of the fact that it can be accessed in a number of languages, perfect for non-English speakers. Yahoo

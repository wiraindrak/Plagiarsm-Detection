This might not seem like much but in-fact it is such a large concern it could actually be a book topic. Effectively, it sits at the root of the and is equally one of the gravest weaknesses in many training environments. For those with a martial arts background, this will not be anything new to you, as it is easily described as "stance keeping." Stance keeping or the ability to hold proper body-position and "rooting" with correct posture is a fundamental point in exercise. But as exercise machinery has moved into the gym floors, postural alignment and the ability to maintain proper alignment under duress has been
weeded-out of the training hierarchy. When you look at a performance or a movie or a work of art, look for what is good and true in it, not what doesn't work. Rather than homing in on what doesn't work, look for the truth and make that expand to fill all the hollows and empty spaces.

by: Anssi Manninen, M.H.S.I read your catalogs all the time. Lately, I'm seeing that you guys are really emphasizing ultra-fast-acting proteins like these new hydrolyzed whey products. So here's my question: If I'm consuming protein all day, both from food sources and from protein shakes, don't I always have aminos cruising my bloodstream? If I'm perpetually maxed on bioavailable aminos, why do I need to worry about slow-, medium- or fast-acting proteins? Thanks and keep up the good work! MyoZene Anssi Manninen, M.H.S., Ph.D., is a well-published research scientist in the sports nutrition field. You obviously want to switch from the catabolic state to the anabolic state as soon as possible, right? To do so, you need to rapidly elevate blood amino acid
and insulin levels (Insulin is an anabolic hormone that helps transport amino acids into hungry muscle cells). The best way to accomplish this goal is to ingest a serving of immediately
after exercise.

Individual muscle parts can be targeted for training
as the movement is guided by the machine, and workout
stations can be utilised according to
your personal needs. The
correct choice of training
weight and proper
execution of the exercises will help you to
achieve your
personal
objective. There are many
options available, and nearly all
systems have their
own weight stack, and some with
pulley systems that can multiply
the resistance of the weights you are lifting.

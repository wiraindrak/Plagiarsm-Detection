The culture of Renaissance Italy was
distinguished by many highly competitive and advanced urban areas. Unlike England and France, Italy possessed no dominating capital city, but developed a number of centers for regional states: Milan for Lombardy, Rome for the Papal States, Florence and Siena for Tuscany, and Venice for northeastern Italy. Yet another musical instrument that has many stories attached to it is the muyu also known as the wooden fish. This is actually a wooden instrument. The legends associated with the wooden fish all have taken place in China. This wooden fish is used especially for rituals by monks. Ancient Chinese musical instruments cannot be complete without the mention of the Yunluo. Drawings recovered from the olden era depict the yunluo with five gongs.

However, even though chant notation had progressed in many ways, one fundamental problem remained: rhythm. The notational system even in its fully developed state did not clearly define any kind of rhythm for the singing of notes.

[] edit Historical context European polyphony rose out of melismatic , the earliest harmonization of the chant. Twelfth century composers, such as and developed the organum that was introduced centuries earlier, and also added a third and fourth voice to the now homophonic chant. In the thirteenth century, the chant-based tenor was becoming altered, fragmented, and hidden beneath secular tunes, obscuring the sacred texts as composers continued to play with this new invention called polyphony. The lyrics of love poems might be sung above sacred texts in the form of a , or the sacred text might be placed within a familiar secular melody. organum L onin P rotin trope Not that the great classics had been unable to write in seconds or to produce dissonances, but in the mixture of the outer-musical macrocosm and the inner-tonal microcosm they
rather knew the natural limits, which exist as long as the musician does not master the microcosm of music.   The Twelve-Tone Music and the Serial Composing Technique       Therefore, the great classical composers from Bach to Wagner only approached, but never crossed, the border to disharmony, and thus created mostly harmonious music.

For many of us, our focus is guided by our exposure to Mozart's personality in the film , but is that an accurate picture? Mozart's life remains a complicated puzzle. As a child, he seemed gifted beyond all measure, playing at age six before the empress, and composing at an even earlier age. By twelve he had written an opera, and his talents seemed to know no bounds. In 1613, he was appointed maestro di cappella at St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice. He remained in Venice for the rest of his life, writing music in all genres, including his final opera, (1642). Monteverdi wrote in a style that he called the , a description he used to separate himself from the more conservative tradition of and his contemporaries. For
Monteverdi, the starting point was always the words. Whatever mood the words might suggest, or whatever effect a single word needed to convey, was reflected in the music. This is the basic idea of word painting used in madrigals throughout the century. Their calm, slow melodies are built up from paired phrases reminiscent of plainchant.

The British Invasion spawned a wave of imitators in the U.S.A. and across the globe. Many of these bands we're cruder than the bands they tried to emulate. Playing mainly to local audiences and recording cheaply, very few of these bands broke through to a higher level of success.

throughout Italy for his ability to write music that was both dramatic and expressive of word and text. At this time, a new musical idiom was being invented, a combination of drama and musicand Monteverdi was chosen to write the music for a court entertainment in this new style. The result was , based on the story of Orpheus, the legendary hero of Greek mythology who sang and played the so wonderfully that animals, trees, and rocks were moved to dance. When a snake killed Orpheus' wife Eurydice, he followed her to the Underworld and, with music and song, persuaded Hades to release her. The theorist who is most well recognized in regards to this new style is , famous for writing the ("New Art") treatise around 1322. This treatise on music gave its name to the style

court appointment he held, Mozart replied: "I get paid far too much for what I do, and far too little for what I could do." His music did not always
please those in power: "Too many notes," Emperor Joseph II was reported to have said. And Mozart himself, who always felt that his talents were never
adequately recognized, was often difficult. The difficulties of Mozart the man, however, are eclipsed by the enormous power of Mozart the musician. His music was often joyous and almost raucous, and yet he could also write melodies of simple and haunting beauty.

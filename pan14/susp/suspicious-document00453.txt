NEW YORK  The trial of Martha Stewart, which began Tuesday in federal court here, will hinge on the very quality upon which Stewart built her successful career: perfection. Martha Stewart arrives at the
federal courthouse in Manhattan Tuesday. Ed Betz, AP The U.S. Attorney in Manhattan has accused Stewart and her broker, Peter Bacanovic, of lying to obstruct an investigation into possible illegal trading
on inside information, stemming from her sale of ImClone stock two years ago. Stewart and her broker insist they're innocent. With a wave to supporters outside and a barely audible plea of innocent inside,
proceedings began. Stewart reiterated her plea of "not guilty" to all five counts of the indictment before jury selection began. Co-defendant Peter Bacanovic also pleaded innocent to the latest version of
the indictment, which made mostly cosmetic and typographical changes. Who knows? Maybe Martha pulled
it off anyway. Maybe other Santa
clones have already been
produced and released into the
atmosphere. Now that wee in the midst of the Christmas cycle, you need to ask yourself this: Is the
Santa at the
mall the real Santa or is he a Santa
clone? See what I mean? About this conspiracy and cover-up? These
Santa
clones? It just makes you wonder. I
can only be sure of one
thing. The
government also said
Bacanovic altered his personal notes about Stewart's portfolio after
he learned the government was investigating her, trying to create the impression he and Stewart had a prior agreement to sell ImClone if it fell below $60 a share. The charges spell not just serious legal headaches for Stewart, but a crisis for her company, which has struggled with a public relations nightmare that has
grown since she became involved in
the stock scandal a year
ago. A
fascinated public has watched
Stewart try to keep her
highly profitable public persona intact, doling out advice on decorating or preparing a tasty dinner on a television program, while news
headlines have focused on the criminal cases of close friends or her legal troubles. Merrill Lynch completed her sell order shortly thereafter,
at
an average sale
price of about $58. Because the two-minute Stewart-Faneuil conversation is criticalboth to assessing the propriety of the trade and to the arguments of the prosecution and defenseit needs to be
considered in detail. Before we do
this, however, we need to review what else was happening that morninga subject to which I will return in my next dispatch. ImClone's stock subsequently plunged. Stewart has maintained that she had a
standing order with her Merrill Lynch broker, Bacanovic, to sell the shares if the
stock fell below $60. Just this week, a new study conducted in Europe, found Erbitux worked just as well as a cancer treatment as a
disputed study conducted earlier, and sponsored by ImClone, said it
did. Shareholder Fraud InfoCenter does not offer

Shareholder fraud occurs when the
employees
of a corporation
deliberately deceive the company’s shareholders by misrepresenting information. Fraud includes
activities
such as doctoring
account books and exaggerating
claims about products or
services. When these illegal actions result in a drop
in stock value, the shareholders can
file suit for the money they have lost. There have been several
high-profile examples of shareholder fraud in recent years. Nutritionals Please click on the product

profits between 1996 and 1999. The disappointingly short
list of the indicted and/or jailed includes a handful of Enron execs,
Tyco's Dennis Kozlowski, ImClone's Sam Waksal...and not many more. Though they and
their deeds are rich with symbolic value, almost none of them have
become household names.
The two counts against Stewart for making false statements concerned one count for each of two
interviews with the SECmdash;ne on
Feb. 4, 2002, and a follow-up interview on April 10, 2002. Jurors were required to look at specific statements made during each interview, and determined Stewart told six lies in the first meeting and
two in the second. Bacanovic was convicted of making a false statement during a Jan 7, 2002, interview with federal authorities. The perjury charge stems from a Feb. 13, 2002, interview, in which Bacanovic was under oath. were her frantic words to Merrill Lynch.th The mainstream press frenzied itself when it learned of the
stock trade and reported that Martha had dumped her shares based on insider info about FDA test results for ImClone experimental cancer
drug. So frenzied was Dan Rather that
he gave up night classes studying El Niňo to come back
ON
AIR. The ImClone story was hot, hotter than even El Niňo. It all
smelled fishy to me from the get-go. Findlaw documents Stewart's message log Armstrong said she had never seen Stewart alter a phone
message prior to that day.
Federal
prosecutors hope
Armstrong's
statements will show that Stewart sought to cover up
details about her ImClone stock trade. Meanwhile, Helene
Glotzer, an assistant regional
director at the SEC, took the stand after Armstrong to testify about
the SEC's initial interview with Stewart on Feb. 4, 2002. Dennis Kozlowski, former chief financial
officer Mark Schwartz, and former
general counsel Mark Belnick are accused of issuing themselves loans with company money in order to make
extravagant
personal
purchases. The
former CEO and CFO are
also accused
of issuing bonuses to themselves and other employees who had borrowed money from the company. The bonuses acted as de facto loan
repayment. Finally, all three men are accused of selling their own Tyco stock without informing the
board of directors, as they were
required to do under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. They have all pled innocent.What is shareholder fraud or corporate fraud? Stewart said she may have told Mariana
Pasternak, a friend of Stewart and a key government witness, about her stock sale and she may have also told Kevin Sharkey, an employee at Martha Stewart Living, Glotzer told the court. Stewart and
Bacanovic are accused of lying
to
cover up the reason for Stewart's ImClone sale,
which the government contends
was an inside tip -- passed from
Bacanovic through his assistant to Stewart -- that
ImClone founder Sam Waksal was trying to sell that day. "I am obviously distressed by the jury's verdict but I continue to take comfort in knowing that I have the confidence and enduring support of my
family and friends," she wrote. "I believe in the fairness of the judicial system and remain confident that I will ultimately prevail." One juror, Chappelle Hartridge, told reporters following the verdict that it made no difference to the panel that Stewart did not take the stand./p> "If we had enough evidence, it wouldn't
have mattered if Martha got on the stand
to say the contrary," he said. "This criminal case is about lying -- lying to the FBI, lying to the SEC and investors," U.S. Attorney James Comey said. "That is conduct that will not be
tolerated. Martha Stewart is being prosecuted not because of who she is, but what she did." Stewart, 61, has denied wrongdoing in the ImClone stock sale. She claimed to have had an arrangement with her broker for the automatic sale of the stock when it dropped to a certain price. Stewart, wearing a pale khaki-colored
trenchcoat and carrying an off-white umbrella, arrived
at
the federal courthouse in Manhattan just before noon,
breezing past a crowd of reporters and camera crews without a word. 23, 2003 Some Preliminary Conclusions Related articles from the archives: Slate Sam Waksal apologizes to everyone but Martha Stewart."Moneybox," Daniel Gross, June 11, 2003 Contrite Executive Watch, Part 3 : Four years ago, Martha Stewart warned her

Inigo Thomas, Oct. Thus, given Ruby
Ridge and
Waco and the willingness of people to work in a government department
that knowingly and consciously permits and tolerates such foul corruption within their midst, one could not help but be amused at U.S. Attorney David Kellys indignation in the Martha Stewart case when he
said with much
severity and gravity after her
conviction,
When we
first indicted this
case, we said it was
about lies, all about lies. As you saw in the evidence, thats what it was. What was even more amusing
is that he was able
to keep a straight face when he said it. Ferris. We them broken. Youd better get it straight that its not a bunch of boy scouts youre
up against  then youll know that this

gestures. Were after power and we
mean it. You fellows were pikers, but we know the real
trick, and youd better get wise to it. Theres no way to rule innocent men. The only power any
government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there arent enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many
things to be a crime that it becomes
impossible for
men to live without breaking laws.

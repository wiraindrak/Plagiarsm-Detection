Another advantage is that PVC is a
long-life material that can be recycled up to
ten times without any loss in performance, making it ideal for use in new building products such as window and door profiles, fascias and soffits. The PVC-U industry is continually looking to develop new products from recycled material, such as cladding and window cills made from 100% recycled PVC-U. while X-ray detectors can scan, and remove, only PVC. Keeping in mind most of manufacturer of NIR detectors guarantee about 96% separation, according with the initial level of contamination,
you should install one, two or whatever number of pieces to get at the end a residual contamination of less than 30 PP total. 09/06/2008 9:38 am
Benefits of PVC over other materials PVC is replacing traditional building materials such as wood, metal, concrete and clay in many applications. Versatility, cost effectiveness and an excellent record of use mean it is the most important polymer for the construction sector, which accounted for 60 per cent of European PVC production in 2006. Polyvinyl chloride, PVC, is one of the most popular plastics used in building and construction. It is used in drinking water and waste water pipes, window frames, flooring and roofing foils, wall coverings, cables and many other applications as it provides a modern alternative to traditional materials such as wood, metal, rubber and glass. Many of the products that we use in the NICU are made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC or "vinyl") plastic.  To make PVC
flexible, manufacturers add chemicals like di(2 –ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP).  These softening agents, or plasticizers, are commonly added to PVC medical devices.  The problem with DEHP is that it doesn’t stay in the plastic.  Not chemically bound to PVC, it leaches out of medical devices, leading to human exposure to DEHP,  including to  neonates in the NICU . DEHP, as well as other phthalates, also leaches out of PVC building materials/furnishings, contaminating the general environment.  These sources can also contribute to  . For the new pipe, Scripps chose a patented and trademarked fusible PVC pipe produced by Poway, Calif.-based Underground Solutions. Contractors used a special drill to bore a path for the pipe, and then pulled the pipe through. This trenchless installation method caused minimal disturbance on campus.  Contractors also found the PVC was just flexible enough to allow them to thread the pipe through underground
areas that were crowded with utilities. The project, completed last year, used more than 4,000 feet of Underground Solutions Fusible PVC™ pipe. Fabian reported that, thanks largely to the PVC project, the State of California is satisfied with the substantial progress Scripps has made toward meeting the new requirements. About Challenges Vinyl 2010 is a substantial commitment by the PVC industry and faces many practical, short term and long term challenges:  PVC waste is becoming a progressively more valuable commodity.  Rising oil prices - and therefore prices for virgin PVC - as well as vigorous economic growth in the Far East are combining to make ‘end-of-life' PVC applications increasingly valuable for direct re-use.  We believe that certain PVC products - pipes for example - may be lasting
even longer in service than we had expected.  This in turn means that less waste may be available for collection and recycling. A practical difficulty that will only be surmounted by sustained effort is to access PVC products, often sold long ago, at the time of their end-of-life, so that they can be made available for collection and recycling.  This often poses serious logistical challenges to Vinyl 2010 in pursuit of its recycling targets.

WeatherMaster® Vertical Window
System combine the open feeling of a screen room and the
comfort and convenience of a three season sunroom. It does this by utilizing the unique design of the vertical 4-track vinyl window. This type of window is ideally suited to kitchens particularly when situated above sinks or other appliances. The fact that the
window opens fully means that any unwanted smells or
steam can be dissipated rapidly and without fuss. Conservatories and sun lounges are also good places for this type of window. Indeed any room that is liable to get overly warm benefits from the ability of the pvc casement window to catch the maximum of amount of breeze. Pvc casement windows are very easy to open as there is no lifting involved. This makes them ideal for any position where access is slightly hampered, such as above a counter or sink in a kitchen. All life on earth started
in salted oceans and still nearly all life on earth needs salt to survive. Too much salt is a deadly poison, not enough salt is deadly too. Our blood contains salt, our stomach uses hydrochloric acid - derived from salt - for the digestion of our food. And when we are attacked by bacteria, white blood cells produce a powerful chlorinating and oxidising agent from salt: hypochlorite to kill the invaders. Contractors love this lightweight piping material. Just follow some simple, common-sense steps: Installing PVC Follow local code requirements. Follow recommended safe
work
practices. Follow proper handling procedures. Read the manufacturer's installation instructions. Keep pipe and fittings in original packaging until needed. Cover pipe and fittings with an opaque tarp if stored outdoors. Inspect pipe for damage prior to use. Use tools specifically designed for use with plastic pipe. Use a drop cloth to protect finishes in the work area. When joining PVC pipe and fittings with solvent cement, always: Cut the pipe ends square. Bevel and deburr the pipe ends with a chamfering tool. The article claims that the researchers tested four phthalates; in fact, they tested eight phthalates and found no correlation for four of them. This kind of skewed reporting only serves to undermine the honest rendering of scientific results to the public. Even if we accept that the study established a correlation between the anogenital index (AGI) and the
presence of phthalate metabolites in the mother’s urine, we have to ask: what does this mean? (New York, NY) A new national study released today found for the first time ever that over 60% of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) packaging tested contains toxic heavy metals that violate state toxics in packaging laws in 19 states. Inks and colorants used on plastic shopping and mailing bags were the other packaging materials with frequently detected heavy metals.  The study was conducted by the , a network of nine state environmental agencies coordinating toxics in packaging legislation. Toxics In Packaging Clearinghouse “This new study underscores the need for a global phase out of PVC packaging,” said Michael Schade, PVC Campaign Coordinator with the Center for Health,
Environment and Justice.  “PVC packaging contains heavy metals that can harm our health and environment.  Safer PVC-free packaging is widely available and innovative companies are eliminating this poison plastic." 26, 2008  Dale County was finally accepted for a grant to replace leaky cast-iron pipes with PVC pipes, solving water problems affecting more than 300 residents. Napier Field, Ala.

He was employed by Solvay where he worked in production, construction, waste management and safety and environmental arenas and from 1993 to 1997. At the same time, there are scientists who have found no threat to children from the phthalates in toys.somein utero non-industry But Zissou and Dolan don’t believe them because these scientists are probably wrapped up in some big industry-government conspiracy, and the chemicals are “highly unlikely” to be safe anyway. How could you frame a rational challenge to such a position when it has all the aggressive paranoia of a McCarthyite witchhunt? The writers, it seems, don’t feel they have to defend their suppositions (by checking out who has done the research – reporting – or by suggesting some mechanism by which it is likely that
phthalates are toxic at current exposure levels) because – – they have been banned in Europe. Vinyls toughness and durability make it the most widely used plastic for applications such as siding, windows, roofing, fencing, decking, wallcoverings and flooring.

Using materials A controversial but affordable siding choice siding often evokes strong emotions in green builders. For some, the flimsy feel of a vinyl-clad wall, or the environmental problems associated with the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), is enough to dissuade them from using the product. Others, however, are won over by vinyl's many strengths. It's an inexpensive, low-maintenance, well-ventilated siding option. From a building science perspective, it performs extremely well, and moisture problems are rare. The Bien Hoa unit in manufactures plasticized and rigid compounds and compounds for medical applications.Vinyl Compounds manufactures and markets

the Prognos Study, assessed the contribution of four PVC products to sustainable development by evaluating their ecological, social and economic impact. PVC pipes, windows and cables proved to have good short and medium term potential for sustainable development, while special applications of PVC rigid films showed favourable short and long-term prospects. The results of the
Prognos Study highlight areas for
the industry to focus on in their efforts to achieve
the long-term sustainability of PVC
products. The experts recommended a strategy for all of the product
groups investigated to the PVC industry that attempts to maintain the short and medium term market position by means of continual improvement. Wood may not be the most durable framing material because of its susceptibility to rot, but a well-built window will last for a long time if properly maintained. It also performs well thermally-speaking, with a of 0.3 - 0.5. U-factor A Wood clad window is another option where the exterior of the frame is clad with vinyl or aluminum to weather the elements better than exposed wood. If you want to be assured
that the wood used comes from
well-managed forests, look for those made using sustainably-harvested wood, like from the following manufacturers who typically service both residential and commercial markets: Health Care Without Harm introduced the NICU Pledge to recognize the many NICUs who already have committed to reducing their use of PVC/DEHP and to help additional hospitals reduce their use of DEHP.  The Pledge outlines steps for a commitment to reduce DEHP-containing medical devices, flooring and other materials in the NICU.  By reviewing the NICU Pledge and endorsing it on behalf of your hospital, you will be identified as a leader in the NICU community on environmental stewardship, one of health care's essential responsibilities. The question of vinyls suitability as a green material also persists because vinyl-product manufacturers and trade groups have falsely created the impression that there is a raging debate about whether or not vinyl is eco-friendly. But one searches in vain for anyone who champions vinyl as a green building product who does not have an interest in the industry. After careful investigations of vinyls properties and the costs and methods used to produce and dispose of
it, organizations as diverse as Kaiser Permanente health care, Apple, Whole Foods Market, and Wal-Mart Stores have committed to phase out vinyl. Calendar Target to phase out hazardous PVC Great news came
from Tar-jay this week. This letter
from the group Making Our Milk Safe describes the actions the mega-retailer will be taking: Dear MOMS Member: On the heels of our victory in California to ban phthalates in children's products, we're writing to share some incredible news of another big win. After working with our coalition partners for a year and a half to persuade Target, one of the nation's top retailers, to phase out PVC, the company today announced plans to eliminate the chemical from its private label products and packaging. This means relentlessly improving production processes and products, investing in
technology, minimising emissions
and waste and boosting collection and recycling.  The programme is based on the ‘Voluntary Commitment' signed by Vinyl 2010's . After publication, the Commitment received a wide range of comments during extensive public and political consultations, including from the European Commission's Directorate General Environment and Directorate General Enterprise. These led, in 2001, to a revised and expanded document. four member associations The main
commitments are: Compliance with ECVM Charters on PVC production standards. A plan for full replacement of lead stabilisers by 2015, in addition to the replacement of cadmium stabilisers that was achieved in March 2001.

Evidence over 40 years of use does not support that PVC is dangerous. There are great benefits to using PVC in things such as blood bags, medical tubing and operating theatre floors. Alternatives to PVC may not have the same range of physical properties. The safety of alternatives should also be considered. Disposal of PVC Incineration of PVC can release toxic gases and dioxins into the
atmosphere. In landfill, PVC takes many years to break down and can eventually release plasticisers and additives into the ground. In some specific cases in the past, this was true, but the whole chlorine industry and specifically the PVC-industry is only a minor source of dioxins today. In Western countries (measurements in Belgium, The Netherlands, Sweden, UK, Canada and the USA) this is only 0.1% of the dioxin releases to air. The most important sources were old incinerators, the domestic incineration of wood and the metal industry. And the amount
of PVC - or chlorine - input plays no role in the
amount of dioxins formed at incinerators. Only
the quality of incineration matters. See: Sources of dioxins. Greenpeace and other environmental groups want a ban on all use, because it gives dioxins when produced and incinerated. Hardwood
sales dropped 12.2 in 2007, and 10.1 percent in volume.  Carpet and area rug sales fell 5.6 in value, and 7.9 percent in units.    Greg Bocchi, president of The Vinyl Institute, stated, "The growth of vinyl flooring sales in 2007, despite a down construction market, reveals the versatility, durability, and cost/performance advantages offered by these polyvinyl chloride based materials.  Once again, a vinyl product proves it is the best flooring option available."   The Vinyl
Institute represents the leading manufacturers
involved in the production of
PVC
vinyl in the United States, and promotes the value of PVC vinyl to society.   The
features of the particular plastic are determined by its
chemical composition and type of molecular structure (molecular formation: crystalline/amorphous structure) PVC has an amorphous structure with chlorine atoms in the molecular structure. Having chlorine atoms and the amorphous molecular structure are inseparably related. Although plastics seem very similar in the context of daily use, PVC has completely different features in terms of performance and functions compared with olefin plastics which have only carbon and hydrogen atoms in their molecular structures. polar Molecular structures of general purpose plastics Chemical stability is a common feature among substances containing halogens such as chlorine and fluorine.

significantly. These days
sophisticated locking mechanism have replaced the old simple latch system and so pvc casement windows are at least as secure as any others. The window and frame are typically manufactured as a single unit and the locking systems built in. It is also often possible to lock the window in an open position. It is possible to get pvc casement windows in a wide variety of frames including metal, plastic and wood. The pane is typically double-glazed and the window is delivered with the frame as a complete double-glazed
package. Pvc casement window make a great option for providing light and airy atmospheres to any room. Welcome to You Choose!

CO is a sneaky killer, since we cannot smell it and most people die in fires while sleeping. And of course CO is emitted by all organic materials, be it wood, textile or plastics. PVC as well as some other materials also emits acids. These emissions can be smelled and are irritating, making people try to run away from the fire. A specific acid, hydrochloric acid (HCL), is connected with burning PVC . To the best of our knowledge, no fire victim has ever been proven scientifically to have suffered HCl poisoning. Some years ago no big fire was discussed without dioxins playing a major role both in communication and
measuring programmes. Researchers studying the
effects of DEHP on animals have uncovered disturbing evidence relevant to humans.  DEHP adversely affects the developing male reproductive system, with neonates being especially vulnerable.  An expert panel of the National Toxicology Program’s Center for Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction concluded that DEHP raised "serious concerns" for neonates .The Food and Drug Administration concurred with the NTP findings and issued a  public health notification recommending the use of alternatives to DEHP where exposures might be excessive, including in the NICU. This
means acting in a way which does not limit the range of economic, social and environmental options available for future generations. We have to use natural
resources as effectively as
possible in the production of consumer goods. PVC makes the most of valuable resources by using the minimum amount of raw materials and energy during manufacture and processing. Today, PVC is lighter, stronger and more adaptable than ever before thanks to continuing technological innovation. This means that product for product, proportionally less of the world's oil and energy resources are being used with lower overall impact on the environment.

Administrator User 11/08/2008 5:02 pm Plastics are also called synthetic resins and are broadly classified into two
categories;
thermosetting resins and thermoplastic resins. The thermosetting resins include phenolic resin and melamine resin, which are thermally hardened and never become soft again. Thermoplastic resins include PVC, polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP), which can be re-softened by heating. Main synthetic resins and their raw materials chart   Usually, thermoplastics are supplied in the form of pelletised material (compounds) with additives (antioxidants, etc.) already blended in it.
However, PVC resin is often supplied
in powder form and long term storage is possible since the material is resistant to oxidation and degradation. Because phthalates are semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), not volatile organic compounds (VOCs), they are not accounted for in most indoor air quality () tests, which focus only on VOCs. Thus, vinyl products can obtain IAQ certifications even though they leach phthalates, whose contributions to reproductive-system impairment include infertility, testicular damage, reduced sperm count, suppressed ovulation, and abnormal development and
function of the testes and male
reproductive tract in laboratory animals. They are known carcinogens in laboratory
animals. IAQ Indoor air quality. Healthfulness of an interior environment; IAQ is affected by such factors as moisture and mold, emissions of volatile organic compounds from paints and finishes, formaldehyde emissions from cabinets, and ventilation effectiveness. Some companies also defended PVC as environmentally friendly.  Both Play & Park Structures and GameTime are brands of Playcore, based in Chattanooga, Tenn., and publicized their PVC deck coatings.  Their flyers feature half-page sections titled "The Truth Behind PVC,"  reporting PVC products save countless lives through their use in medical tubing and blood bags and other patient care products for over 50 years.  They noted PVC is an insignificant source of dioxin, PVC production is energy efficient with little unwanted by-product, additives in flexible PVC are not leached from landfill PVC products, and PVC products make up less than 1 percent of landfills.  Both companies also state their PVC decks contain 68 percent of post-consumer recycled content.  
Reveilletown,
Louisiana, was once a small African-American town
adjacent to an EDC/VCM
facility owned by Georgia-Gulf. In the 1980s,
after a plume of vinyl chloride in
groundwater began to seep under homes in the area, Georgia-Gulf agreed to permanently evacuate the entire community of one hundred and six residents. Reveilletown has since been demolished. A national coalition of over 60 health and environmental organizations are calling on Target to phase out PVC packaging and products.  Since October, over 40,000 Target customers have signed petitions and sent letters to the company and over 200 events have been held at Target stores across the country. Nineteen states have laws that prohibit the sale or distribution of packaging containing intentionally added cadmium, lead, mercury, and hexavalent chromium.  The states with this legislation are California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. • Door panel manufactured from Polyester reinforced fire retardant PVC coated with UV absorbers and including a clear PVC safety vision panel.

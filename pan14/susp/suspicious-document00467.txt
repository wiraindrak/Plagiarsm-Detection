Vines 8 years old have yielded 18,000 lbs per acre (20 MT/ha), which is
nearly the maximum for mature plants (8 to 10 years old). The bearing habits of the vine are variablea light crop one season is likely to be followed by a heavy crop the next season, andvice versa. Keeping Quality Firm fruits can be kept 8 weeks at room temperature, 65º to 70º F (18.33º-21.11º C). Fully ripe fruits can be kept for a week or more in the home refrigerator. Fruits harvested at the firm stage will keep for long periods at 31º to 32º F (-0.56º-0º C) and at least 90% relative humidity, wrapped in unsealed polyethylene in containers. Lower relative humidity, even 85%, will cause a weight loss of as much as 4.5% in 6 weeks. Make a fresh fruit drink by blending
kiwifruit in a fruit blender. Kiwifruit can be used as a tenderizer. meat Kiwifruit can be used in fruit tarts. Blend kiwifruit, cantaloupe and yoghurt in a food processor to make a chilled soup. [] edit Safety Kiwifruit contain measurable amounts of oxalates If oxalates become too concentrated in body fluids, they can crystallize and cause health problems. Individuals with kidney or gallbladder problems would be wise to avoid eating this fruit. Kiwi fruit is the edible fruit of Actinidia Deliciosa, and hybrids between this species and
others in the genus Actinidia.
Kiwifruits owe their name to a bird, native of New
Zealand, named "kiwi", and actually in many regions of Europe, North America and South America, kiwi fruits are generally referred to as "kiwi" This fruit consists of a hairy, brown peel containing green flesh, with white pulp in the center, surrounded by black, edible seeds. Kiwifruit needs approximately 850 hours below 45 degrees F for proper dormancy. It is after the vines go dormant that they are ready to be pruned.1. DORMANT SEASON, BEFORE PRUNING   The way the vines are pruned will influence the
next crop's yield in regard to
both the number of pieces of the fruit that set and the size of that fruit.2. EMPLOYEES PRUNING   As winter turns to spring, the warmer awakens the dormant kiwifruit vines which have slept the cold winter months away.

When canned, kiwifruit become mushy and lose their color.kiwifruitkiwi [1] fruit egg Raw kiwifruit is also rich in the protein-dissolving enzyme actinidin, which is commercially useful as a meat tenderizer but can be an allergen for some individuals. Specifically, people
allergic to papayas or pineapples are likely to be allergic to kiwifruit also. This enzyme, which is quickly destroyed by boiling the fruit, makes raw kiwifruit unfit for use in desserts containing milk or any other dairy products. A series of studies published by the Archives of Ophthalmology have proven that consuming 3 or more servings of fruit per day (including kiwi fruits) can reduce by 36% the risk of developing an eye-related disease called (the primary cause of vision impairment in adults), if compared to people who only consume 1.5 servings of fruit per day. ARMD The study was conducted on 110.000 women and men and lasted several decades. Surprisingly, the study found that while vegetables were not correlated with an improved resistance to the disease, fruits containing high amount of Vitamin C,A and E (the most common antioxidant vitamins) helped significantly in protecting against ARMD.

In a tough world market, many exporters competed to sell kiwifruit, driving down the price of the New Zealand fruit. Growers responded by lobbying government to regulate the export sector. Kiwifruit Marketing Board The New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board was established in 1988 and had monopoly powers to distribute and market kiwifruit everywhere except Australia. In 2000 it adopted the corporate identity Zespri International Ltd. Overseas growers So that it could supply kiwifruit year-round, Zespri began to represent some northern-hemisphere growers and gave them rights to grow gold kiwifruit.

A recent development is the raising of kiwifruits in greenhouses in the Channel Islands, especially as an alternative to tomatoes suffering from European competition. The vine was introduced into the Philippines at Baguio in 1923. It succeeds there only above 3,280 ft (1,000 m) and has not been exploited. Large plantings are being made in Chile, not far from Santiago. Varieties There are 4 main Chinese classes of kiwifruit: 1) ("Chinese gooseberry")round to oval, or oblate;

Gold Kiwifruit or "Hinabelle", with yellow flesh and a sweeter, less acidic flavour resembling a tropical , is a new Cultivar Group produced by the New Zealand , and marketed worldwide in increasing volumes. Some wild vines in India have yellow fruit but are small and not commercially viable. Seeds from these plants were imported to New Zealand in 1987 and the company took 11 years to develop the new fruit through cross-pollination and grafting with green kiwifruit vines. Gold Kiwifruit have a smooth, bronze skin, a pointed cap at one end and distinctive golden yellow flesh with a less tart and more tropical flavour than green kiwifruit. It has a higher market price than green
kiwifruit. It is less hairy than the green cultivars, so can be eaten whole after rubbing off the thin, fluffy coat.

The problem of chemical residues Just as the New Zealand kiwifruit industry was regrouping after the global overproduction crisis of the 1980s, a more severe price crash occurred when European kiwifruit began to enter the market around 1991. It was getting harder to sell to key European markets; in particular, Italian officials prosecuted New Zealand exporters for selling kiwifruit with high chemical residues. Kiwifruit growers had traditionally sprayed pests (specifically leafroller and scale insects) by the calendar. To meet early export requirements, orchards had to be inspected and declared free of pests and diseases. Before 1992, up to eight insecticide applications were sprayed each season, compared with only one in hot areas such as Chile and California. The KiwiGreen programme Prosecution prompted the New Zealand
industry to set up an integrated pest-management system. Scientific research shows that if you regularly eat lots of fruit and vegetables you have a lower risk of Type 2 diabetes, Stroke, Cancer (some forms), Heart disease, High blood pressure. Just by eating strawberries, spinach, broccoli, and yams, you can boost your antioxidant level, and strengthen your immune system, to fight off infectious diseases. The recommended amount of fruit and vegetables a day is five to nine
servings. However, the average
person consumes less than one
serving
daily. If the simple fact that fruit and vegetables
are a powerful preventive medicine in preventing chronic disease in the future doesn't get you to eat more fruits and vegetables today, then you might want to consider the immediate health benefits. Nevertheless, trial shipments of canned fruits were made to West Germany in 1980. Specimens of the plant were collected by the agent for the Royal Horticultural Society, London, in 1847 and described from his dried material, In 1900, seeds gathered in Hupeh were sent to England by E.H. Wilson.
The resulting plants flourished and bloomed in
1909. When both male and
female vines were
planted together, fruits were produced but usually
only solitary vines were grown as ornamentals. Seeds from China were introduced into New Zealand in 1906 and some vines bore fruits in 1910. Several growers raised numerous seedlings (many of which were males) and selected the best fruiting types, which were propagated around 1930. By 1940 there were many plantings, one with 200 vines, especially on the eastern coast of the North Island. This means that it can tenderize other foods such as salads and meat, and is the main cause of the "latex allergy" (which often manifests with itching in the mouth for allergic subjects). It is generally a good practice to add kiwi fruit just before serving, to prevent actinidin from overly tenderizing other foods Kiwifruit serving ideas Kiwifruits can be eaten as is, scooped or cut in slices The peel contains many nutrients, and can be eaten once the hairy bits have been removed by soft brushing Kiwifruits add a delicious "tropical" feel to salads, try it!

Wikipedia Kiwifruit It should be noted that to a New Zealander, the kiwi is the flightless and endangered national bird. So, it is best to avoid talking about eating a kiwi with them.
Also, kiwi is used as a general term for a New Zealander, that is another reason why they call the fruit the kiwifruit instead. Some of the more important published sources quoted include (Ortho Books,1985); by Leslie Johns and Violet Stevenson (Angus and Robertson, 1985); by Julia F. Morton (1987); (National Academy Press, 1989); by Wilson Popenoe (1920, reprinted 1974 by Hafner Press); by Lee Reich (Addison-Wesley, 1991); 2nd ed., by J.A.

Summary of Kiwifruit Health Benefits Eating kiwi fruit is clearly a healthy choice, and it is particularly useful in these cases: Prevents Asthma Prevents wheezing and coughing, especially in children Protects our DNA from mutations Provides a healthy amount of
antioxidants and
vitamins Helps prevent colon cancer thanks to a high fiber content The first exports of Chinese gooseberries were in 195253, from a few orchards in Te Puke, Bay of Plenty. Growers sent trial shipments to the UK and Australia, where the fruit was well received. Early exporters learned by trial and error the complexities of growing, harvesting, sorting, packing and storing a tender fruit for faraway markets. The overseas demand for kiwifruit grew steadily in the 1950s and 1960s. During this period, kiwifruit producers intensified their use of chemical pesticides,
adopted industrial production techniques such as mechanical sorting of fruit, and built large cool stores to hold the fruit ready for export.

Financial success and the appeal of the orchardists lifestyle attracted investors and new growers, and kiwifruit-growing expanded to new areas such as Northland and Hawkes Bay. However, unstable interest rates and exchange rates and increased world supplies of kiwifruit led to an industry crisis between 1987 and 1989.

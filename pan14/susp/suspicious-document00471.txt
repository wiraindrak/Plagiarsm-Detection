Click to enlarge > On board each Voyager spacecraft is a time capsule: a 12-inch,
gold-plated copper disk carrying spoken greetings in 55 languages from Earth’s peoples, along with 115 images and
myriad sounds representing our home planet. Selected for NASA by Carl Sagan and others, and produced by science writer Timothy Ferris, the disks are essentially a “greatest hits” package portraying the biodiversity of Earth and the diversity of human cultures. From the Golden Gate to the Great Wall, Beethoven to Chuck
Berry, from mountain breezes to crashing surf, a dog’s howl and a baby’s cry, the disks may someday serve as “letters of introduction”
to a
passing extraterrestrial civilization that may stop and inspect the robots and become inquisitive about their place of
origin. More On
This Topic Because they are composed of these so-called “icy” materials, Uranus and Neptune are now being called “ice giants.” 
However, the icy materials are likely not solid; they probably exist in a liquid, soupy state in the interiors
of the two planets.  There might or might not be a solid, rocky core underneath it all.  Unfortunately, there is no
way to find
out for sure what the interiors of these planets are like without an orbiting spacecraft that can measure the planets’ gravitational fields highly accurately. Uranus’ Magnetic Field The magnetic field of
Uranus
is strongly tilted with respect to the planet. Pluto Small Bodies This is a collection of many of the best images from NASA's planetary
exploration
program.
The collection has been extracted from the interactive program "Welcome to the Planets"
which was distributed on the Planetary Data System Educational CD-ROM Version 1.5 in December 1995. It has also been updated with the addition of more
recent images.Please note: This collection replaces the former on-line version of Welcome to the Planets. Internal

Activities, Web Links INSIDE URANUSUranus is a frozen, gaseous planet. : The planet is shrouded in an icy cloud layer (made up of frozen methane, ethane, and acetylene) circling this planet at 185 mph (300 kph. Uranus' icy atmosphere consist of 83% ,15% , and 2% . The outer layers of the atmosphere are the coldest; temperature and pressure rise under the cloud layer. : Beneath the atmosphere, there is a liquid layer of hydrogen and helium. As depth
increases, this layer becomes
more viscous, and then partly solid. This layer may be composed of compressed water with ammonia and methane. : Uranus has a molten rocky core about 10,500 miles (17,000 km) in diameter and about 12,500°F (6927°C). This core may have a mass five
times greater than the mass of
the . PLANETARY COMPOSITION AND ATMOSPHERE The storm GS-37S shows up in the right image, at the lower left of the globe. The band of clouds in the north of the same image is about 18,000 kilometers (11,000 miles) long. Credit: Lawrence Sromovsky / W. M. Keck Observatory Click to enlarge > Uranus in the infrared Uranus’ storms tend to show up in “alleys” of storm activity within one latitude band.  Some of the storms seem to persist for a long period of time; one storm, dubbed “the Great Spot at 37S,” or GS-37S,
may have persisted from the
time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1986 to recent Hubble and Keck II observations.  Other clouds seem to bloom and disappear over periods of only days. 
The changes in Uranus’ circulation patterns being seen today are not explained by present theories for Uranus’ atmospheric structure and circulation. Uranus Rings Fact Sheet Rings of Uranus Radius

planets (because its great gravity squeezes its core at very high pressures into a very dense state), followed by Saturn,
then Neptune, then
Uranus.  In fact, Neptune is the densest of them all, followed by Uranus and Jupiter, followed by Saturn.  So Uranus and Neptune must be made of denser materials to begin with than the much more massive Saturn and Jupiter.  The
similar outsides are hiding very
different insides.  There must be a much greater proportion of ice and rock in Uranus and Neptune than there is in Jupiter and Saturn.
